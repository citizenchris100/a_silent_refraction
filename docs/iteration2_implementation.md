# Iteration 2: NPC Interaction and Dialog System Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the NPC interaction and dialog system for A Silent Refraction.

## Overview

The implementation focuses on creating a robust and reliable NPC interaction system, based on our findings from debugging previous attempts. The key components are:

1. **Base NPC Class**: Provides core functionality for NPC interactions, dialog, and suspicion tracking
2. **Dialog Manager**: Handles dialog UI and interaction flow
3. **Game Manager**: Coordinates between player, NPCs, and UI elements
4. **Example NPCs**: Concierge and Security Officer with their dialog trees

## Key Features

### Direct Input Handling
- NPCs detect clicks directly using Area2D nodes
- Simple and reliable input detection without complex signal chains

### Dialog System
- Tree-based dialog structure
- Dialog choices affect suspicion level
- Branching conversations with multiple outcomes

### Suspicion System
- Tracks NPC suspicion level (0.0 to 1.0)
- Suspicion threshold that changes NPC behavior when crossed
- Dialog choices can increase or decrease suspicion

### Quest Integration
- Package delivery quest between Concierge and Security Officer
- Item handling in dialog trees
- Game over conditions based on dialog choices

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Run the test script: `./run_implementation_test.sh`
2. Click on the verb "Talk to"
3. Click on an NPC to start a conversation
4. Navigate through the dialog options
5. Observe the suspicion level changes in the console

## Next Steps

1. **Integrate with inventory system**: Add items to player inventory and enable their use in dialog
2. **Implement more NPCs**: Create additional NPCs for different districts
3. **Add quest tracking**: Create a quest log to track mission progress
4. **Implement game over handling**: Proper game over screens and state management
5. **Add proper graphics**: Replace placeholder visuals with game art

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Check the console for error messages
- Verify that all script paths are correct
- Make sure the class inheritance is properly set up
- Add print statements to track execution flow
