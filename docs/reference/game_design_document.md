# A Silent Refraction: Game Design Document
**Status: ðŸ“š REFERENCE**

## Design Pillars

1. **You should feel like you're trying to join a functioning little society**
   - The station must feel alive with NPCs going about their daily routines
   - Each district has its own culture and social dynamics
   - Your actions impact how this society perceives and accepts you

2. **The effects of Assimilation should be palpable to the player**
   - Visual and behavioral changes in assimilated NPCs
   - Gradual deterioration of station normalcy
   - Environmental storytelling showing the spread of assimilation

3. **There needs to be a sense of finite time**
   - Time progression system with meaningful consequences
   - NPCs get assimilated as days pass
   - Limited opportunities to complete objectives

4. **The player can be a passive part of the game's story or active**
   - **Example of passive**: choosing to spend all your time doing "job quests" like working in the mall to earn money
   - **Example of active**: choosing to participate in quests that lead to getting people to join the coalition
   - **The passive choice has the consequences in witnessing the negative results of assimilation**

5. **There should be a feeling of a struggle to balance how you choose to spend your time**
   - Every action costs time
   - Multiple competing priorities
   - No perfect path through the game

6. **Everything costs money**
   - Station economy is integral to gameplay
   - Need money for basic necessities and quest items
   - Economic pressure adds to time management challenges

7. **Both passive and active routes through the game should yield monetary rewards**
   - Job quests provide steady income
   - Coalition quests offer rewards for success
   - Multiple viable economic strategies

8. **Players should feel they have agency**
   - Multiple solutions to problems
   - Meaningful choices with real consequences
   - Player actions shape the story outcome

9. **No combat**
   - Focus on dialogue, puzzle-solving, and social navigation
   - Tension comes from suspicion and discovery, not violence
   - Conflicts resolved through wit and strategy

10. **No aliens beside the goo and assimilated**
    - The horror is human transformation, not monsters
    - Focus on psychological rather than creature horror
    - The threat comes from within the community

11. **Needs to look like an authentic early 90's 32 bit era game**
    - Limited color palette (16 colors)
    - Pixel art with appropriate resolution constraints
    - UI design consistent with era limitations

12. **Needs to feel like an authentic SCUMM Point & Click Adventure game that you somehow have never heard of**
    - Verb-based interaction system
    - Inventory puzzles
    - The fidelity and level of complexity for graphics on par with early games such as 1990's The Secret of Monkey Island
    - Classic adventure game pacing and humor where appropriate

13. **All music is Diegetic**
    - Music comes from in-world sources (radios, PA systems, etc.)
    - No traditional soundtrack overlay
    - Audio design reinforces the reality of the station environment

14. **Every choice is permanent (Single Save Slot)**
    - One save slot enforces living with consequences
    - No save scumming or trying different approaches
    - Inspired by Dead Rising's punishing save system
    - Saving requires returning to bed and advances time

## Backstory

One of the largest conglomerates on earth 'Aether Corp' has been at the forefront of Mars colonization. A colonist from one of Aether Corps colonial cities on the outskirts of the populated area of mars comes into contact with the remnants of a life form. This life comes in the form of a plasma or goo. This goo is a kind of extraterrestrial collective consciousness. When a sentient life form such as a human comes into contact with the "goo" it is absorbed into the human. The human at this point is now a host to the goo which overcomes the consciousness of the host with its own thus assimilating the host.

Once the first host was assimilated by the goo its immediate instinct was to assimilate others. Their was only enough alien goo left to assimilate two more hosts. The first assimilated host / colonist decided to gather the remaining goo into two vials. It chose to use one vial on a visiting Aether Corp official with the goal of gaining influence within Aether Corp. The now assimilated Aether Corp official was able to then assimilate a high ranking Aether Corp Vice President.

The two assimilated Aether Corp officials are able to get a small sub division within the corp to move forward with "research" into the goo without any non assimilated personnel knowing the true nature of the goo.

The "research" comes in two parallel paths. One is to expedite a search for more "native" pockets of goo on Mars. The other is an effort to synthesize the goo.

Having had some success in the efforts to synthesize the goo. They decide to take this area of the plan to its next phase.

This phase involves having a courier deliver a single vial of the synthesized goo to one of Aether Corps trading outpost stations at the outskirts of known space. Under the auspices of further research. The reality is they want to "see what happens" when the goo is introduced on an active population.

## Station Setting & Layout

The station is subdivided into districts. With each district having several distinct locations within it.

Each district is accessible to one another via the station Tram system.
Each district has a tram station where the player can board a tram to travel to other districts.

The districts are as follows

### Spaceport

This location acts as the space station's equivalent of an "airport". Suited for both commercial departures/arrivals of guests to the station as well as for shipping/cargo trade purposes. This Spaceport also acts as the station's equivalent of a dock or port. Since the station is primarily a trade hub. Here is where ships arrive with their payload of goods and of course depart. The import/export hub of the station.

## Character Development

Both for the player character (the courier) and NPCs who may or may not be assimilated.
I envision this working a bit like Knights of the Old Republic or Mass Effect. Where their are backstory related dialog paths that when pursued give you insight into the NPCs backstory. This could also lead potentially to small side quests for the NPCs

## The Game

This is to be a point and click adventure game.

The player is essentially in an Invasion of the Body Snatchers like scenario where they are trying to navigate who is assimilated and who isn't.

### Character Selection

Upon starting a new game, players are presented with a choice between playing as a male or female version of Alex, the courier. This choice affects:
- The player character's appearance and animations
- How NPCs address and refer to the player (pronouns, titles)
- Certain character interactions and story branches
- The overall experience while maintaining the core narrative

The player assumes the role of the courier, Alex. Per the backstory setup, Alex nor the recipients of the goo are aware of its true nature nor the goal of Aether Corp in introducing the goo on the outpost station.

Soon after arriving at the station, Alex discovers a resistance group that is trying to stop the Assimilated on the station

Their are fundamentally two competing goals for the player

1) Discover and convince "unassimilated" to join the resistance. The gameplay here is focused on figuring out who is and isn't assimilated. Trying to convince those that aren't assimilated of what is going on and to join them and their coalition. All the while not being detected or turned into the faction of assimilated.
2) To investigate why and how this is happening on the station to begin with. This path is more to do with puzzle solving. Piecing together clues to gain access to certain location that will yield information to what is going on. Knowing this information can help with the goal of stopping the "invasion" plot

Their are fundamentally two options or paths for game completion.
The coalition of unassimilated gaining control of the Station
Or
The coalition admitting defeat and having to escape the Station

### Gameplay Mechanics

We need to implement a time passage system similar to Shin Megami Tensei Persona 3 & 4\. Where the player starts and ends each day from their bed or place of rest should they have not been able to make it home. With the understanding that going to sleep will pass the time into the next day. This will inform the importance of time management. The player can only do so much in a day.

#### Save System - Single Slot Design

The game features a **single save slot system** inspired by the original Dead Rising. This deliberate design choice creates several important gameplay dynamics:

1. **No Save Scumming**: Players must live with the consequences of their choices. Once you sleep and save, there's no going back to try a different approach.

2. **Permanent Consequences**: If an NPC gets assimilated or you miss a critical event, that's permanent for this playthrough. This reinforces the game's themes of time pressure and meaningful choices.

3. **Heightened Tension**: Knowing you can't reload an earlier save makes every decision weightier. Approaching a potentially assimilated NPC becomes genuinely nerve-wracking.

4. **Save Location**: Saves occur when sleeping in Alex's room (Room 306 in the Barracks) or designated rest areas. The act of saving advances time, integrating the save system with the time management mechanics.

5. **Backup Save**: The system maintains one backup of the previous save in case of corruption, but players cannot manually access it - it's purely for technical safety.

This punishing save system is core to the experience - every day matters, every choice is permanent, and players must carefully consider when to return to their room to save, as doing so advances time and potentially allows more assimilation to occur.
I don't know the exact math but a certain number of random NPCs will be assimilated each day. Your actions can potentially lower that number.
Actions such as riding the tram, or moving forward with quests will progress time forward. We need a graphical way to not only allow the player to consent to this time commitment but to also display the progression not only within the Days clock. But the day to day progression.

Each district will have multiple NPCs that essentially will have quests. The fulfillment of said quest will clue the player in on who is and isn't Assimilated.
The types of quests arranged from least to most time consuming.

1. Some assimilated will try to trick / trap you with their quests which if you don't catch on will lead to you being assimilated and game over. If you catch on you can turn the tables on the Assimilated which will help the resistance.
   1. Adding a log of known assimilation which tracks their known district / location etcâ€¦ could be helpful
2. Others of course will be legitimate unassimilated NPCs. Completing their quests will gain their trust and they will join you with the resistance.
3. Each location should have a grand multi part quest that if completed will secure that District and save a lot of NPCs from being assimilated. These quests are rather time consuming and the player will only have time to complete one or two.
4. Their is one main multi part quest that crosses all districts. This is the main investigation into how and why the Assimilation plot is happening. Essentially the result of this quest should reveal the backstory to the player. This quest is incredibly time consuming.

A key consideration for the players actions is detection by the assimilated. When you first interact with an unknown NPC you do not know their Assimilated status. There needs to be a suspicion system. Such that if you say the wrong thing or go down a certain path in a conversation thread it could clue a potential Assimilated NPC of your status. Being discovered and captured leads to the player being assimilated which is the only Game Over condition of the game.

### Quests

There should be a Quest Log menu that gives the player key information such as NPCs, Locations and clues to the next step of the Quest.

Events are defined as interactions or occurrences in the game that are triggered by indirect action of the player. They are typically conditional. For example if a user has a certain item in their inventory and enter a certain location then an NPC will talk to them w/o the user initiating the conversation.

The game begins in a fairly linear fashion. In that you have to complete the Intro and First Quest before things start to open up and the player can choose which quest / path they want to take.

#### Intro Quest

##### Quest goals

deliver the case / goo to Science Lead 01 on the Science Deck

Alex (the player character) arrives at the station. They have in their inventory a case that contains the vial of "goo"

##### Event 1

The Stewardess reminds you that the case is to be delivered to the Science Deck within Engineering.

Once it has been delivered it is inferred to Alex they can check into their room.
Their ship won't depart until the morning.

##### Quest completion Criteria

Going to bed in room

#### First Quest

##### Quest goals

To discover / join the resistance group aboard the station.

##### Event 1

Upon awakening a news broadcast is heard on the TV indicating the Station is on lockdown.
The broadcast reveals that no ships can leave and no new arrivals are accepted until the lockdown is lifted.

##### Event 2

Upon entering the Barracks Main Floor Alex is tasked by the Barracks Concierge to deliver a package for him to the Bank Teller within the Bank at the Trading Floor district.
The Concierge package is added to your inventory.

##### Event 3

Upon delivery of the Concierge package to the Bank Teller she will ask you to return something back to the Concierge.
The Bank Teller package is added to your inventory.

##### Event 4

When you make your way to the tram terminal you are approached by a Security Officer that wants to know the nature of your transaction with the bank teller. He wants to know if you received any packages from the teller.

* If you choose to hand over the package from the teller to Security you will be assimilated and its game over.

* If you choose not to you will be detained and taken to the brig.

##### Puzzle 1: Get out of the Brig

1. Within the brig is a toilet and sink with a bar of soap
   1. You can choose to add the soap to your inventory
2. Inspect the item you received from the Bank Teller.
3. You discover it is a key card.
4. If you use the key card on the brig door it will open.
5. You will then need to sneak up on a Security Officer and attempt to knock them out.
   1. You can choose to toss the bar of soap at the Security Guard's head which will knock them out. Otherwise you will be caught
6. You will then have to find the open closet
7. Once finding the open closet you will have the option to hide the Security Guard and change into his uniform.

* If you choose to leave the brig in your normal civilian clothes you will be detained again and its game over.

* If you choose to change into the Security Officer uniform and leave the brig

##### Event 5

Upon leaving the brig the Office Clerk informs you that you need to report for patrol duty at the Mall.

##### Event 6

Upon arriving at the Mall you are approached by the Security Officer you are relieving. He indicates you need to stay on post patrolling the Mall until you are relieved.

##### Puzzle 2: Get out of having to Patrol the Mall

1. If you try to leave the Mall area via Tram the Tram Security Officer will tell you to go back to your post and remain until you're relieved.
2. You discover you can enter stores along the Mall without issue
3. Their will be 4 crimes committed in the Mall. If you stop any one of them the others will not occur and you will be rewarded with credits by those you help.
   1. A thief tries to steal a purse in the main mall floor
   2. Upon entering the Convenience Store a kid tries to shoplift.
   3. A fight breaks out in the Arcade
   4. A man tries to rob the Bar
4. You can use the credits you received from the stopping the crime to purchase civilian clothes
5. Change into said civilian clothes and you can leave the mall.

##### Event 7

Upon arriving back at the Barracks the Concierge asks if you have his item from the Bank Teller. He retrieves it and asks why it was opened. You tell him about what happened with Security and the Concierge then pulls a gun and orders you to follow him.
The two of you go to a hidden back room off the Main Floor of the Barracks.
There you are introduced to a small group of NPCs.
They question who you are.
Eventually revealing their suspicion that there is some kind of conspiracy to take over the station. Revealing that they believe people are being replaced.
They believe the lockdown is being staged to help facilitate this assimilation by the conspirators.
They mention that one of the resistance operatives was investigating a lead on the Engineering deck and disappeared not long after.
They suggest that if you want to help you can speak to the Bank Teller.

##### Quest completion Criteria

## Visual Style Guide

The initial inspiration for this game came when I was watching Paul Verhoeven's 1990 film 'Total Recall'. I love the look and feel of that film. Especially everything that takes place on Mars.
I suppose you could say the look and feel of this game should combine elements of 'Total Recall' (1990), Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982)

### 1\. Core Aesthetic Philosophy

The game combines elements from:

* Total Recall (1990): Gritty Mars colonization, corporate intrigue
* Alien (1979): Isolated horror, industrial space aesthetic
* Blade Runner (1982): Neon-lit dystopia, moral ambiguity
* SCUMM Games (early 90s): Pixel art style, limited color palette

This creates a retro-futuristic space horror adventure with a distinct visual identity.

### 2\. Color Palette

#### Canonical Palette

The game uses the following 16-color palette throughout all environments and UI:

| Color | Hex Code | Description | Primary Usage |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Dark Black | `#212225` | Deep shadows and outlines | UI borders, deep shadows |
| Dark Purple | `#29272c` | Space and darkness | Space backgrounds, shadows |
| Dark Brown | `#3c3537` | Industrial tones | Machine elements, dark areas |
| Medium Brown | `#494543` | Wood and aged materials | Furniture, structure elements |
| Tan Brown | `#58504b` | Natural surfaces | Floors, walls, terrain |
| Green-Gray | `#5e6259` | Utilitarian surfaces | Walls, industrial elements |
| Purple-Gray | `#726b73` | Cold metal and shadows | Metal surfaces, machinery |
| Rusty Pink | `#907577` | Oxidized metal | Rusty machinery, warning elements |
| Blue Gray | `#7b8e95` | Technical surfaces | Computer interfaces, tech elements |
| Muted Purple | `#b18da1` | Accent highlights | UI highlights, special elements |
| Warm Tan | `#c2a783` | Warm light sources | Lamps, warm accents |
| Pale Green | `#a9c2a4` | Alien presence | The "goo", alien elements |
| Light Gray | `#cec6c0` | Light surfaces | UI elements, bright surfaces |
| Warm Cream | `#e4d2c6` | Skin tones, warm light | Character skin, light sources |
| Pale Yellow | `#f3e9c4` | Bright highlights | UI focus, bright indicators |
| Pale Pink | `#fbede4` | Brightest elements | Highlights, bright UI elements |

#### Color Rules

* All game assets must use only colors from this canonical palette
* Use dithering for gradients rather than smooth transitions
* Each district should have its own dominant color theme using palette subsets:
  * Shipping: Industrial browns and grays (`#3c3537`, `#494543`, `#58504b`, `#5e6259`)
  * Mall: Consumer purples and pinks with neon accents (`#726b73`, `#907577`, `#b18da1`)
  * Trading Floor: Financial greens and tans (`#5e6259`, `#a9c2a4`, `#c2a783`)
  * Barracks: Utilitarian grays and blues (`#5e6259`, `#726b73`, `#7b8e95`)
  * Engineering: Mechanical browns and warm accents (`#494543`, `#58504b`, `#c2a783`)

#### Special Effect Colors

* The alien "goo" uses `#a9c2a4` (pale green) with dithered animation patterns
* Computer screens primarily use `#7b8e95` (blue gray) with `#f3e9c4` (pale yellow) for text
* Warning indicators use `#907577` (rusty pink) contrasted with `#f3e9c4` (pale yellow)

## Audio Design

### Core Audio Philosophy - Purely Diegetic Sound

All audio in A Silent Refraction must originate from within the game world itself. There is no non-diegetic soundtrack, no ambient music overlay, and no sound effects that don't have a visible or logical source within the station. This design pillar reinforces the game's commitment to immersion and the feeling of being trapped in a real, functioning space station.

#### Implementation of Diegetic Audio

* **Music Sources**: All music comes from identifiable in-world sources such as:
  * PA system announcements and background music
  * Radios in various locations (offices, shops, common areas)
  * Muzak speakers in elevators and trams
  * TVs playing in waiting areas or bars
  * Arcade machines and jukeboxes
  * Personal music players carried by NPCs

* **Sound Propagation**: Audio should realistically attenuate with distance and be muffled by walls/barriers
* **Player Control**: Players can interact with some audio sources (turning radios on/off, changing stations)
* **Environmental Storytelling**: Audio sources can provide narrative context (news broadcasts about the lockdown, corporate propaganda, etc.)

### Musical Aesthetic - Corporate Banality

The music within the station should evoke a sense of corporate sterility and artificial comfort, drawing inspiration from:

#### Primary Influences

* **Mallsoft/Vaporwave**: That specific subgenre that captures the hollow, consumerist atmosphere of shopping centers
* **MUZAK**: The infamous "elevator music" designed to be pleasant but forgettable
* **Portal's Radio Music**: The eerily cheerful, looping music from Valve's Portal that hints at something sinister beneath the corporate veneer

#### Musical Characteristics

* **Generic and Inoffensive**: Music should feel like it was chosen by committee to offend no one
* **Repetitive but Not Memorable**: Short loops that blend into the background
* **Artificially Upbeat**: Forced cheerfulness that becomes unsettling over time
* **Corporate Identity**: Each district might have its own "branded" musical style:
  * Mall: Upbeat retail muzak with subtle product placement jingles
  * Trading Floor: "Sophisticated" jazz-fusion suggesting prosperity
  * Medical: Calming, new-age inspired loops
  * Barracks: Soft rock and "family-friendly" pop
  * Engineering: Industrial ambient with safety reminder jingles
  * Security: Authoritative orchestral themes mixed with procedural announcements
  * Spaceport: Travel-themed easy listening with departure/arrival chimes

### Ambient Sound Design

Each district has location-specific ambient white noise that grounds the player in the environment:

#### District-Specific Ambience

* **Spaceport**: 
  * Distant engine hums
  * Pressurization hisses
