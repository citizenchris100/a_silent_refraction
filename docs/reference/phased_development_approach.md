# Phased Development Approach

## Overview

A Silent Refraction's development follows a three-phase approach that ensures systematic building from foundational systems to full content implementation. This approach minimizes rework, validates systems early, and creates reusable patterns for efficient content creation.

## Core Development Philosophy

Development is divided into three interconnected groups:
1. **Systems** - Core game mechanics and technical infrastructure
2. **Assets/Content** - Locations, NPCs, and their visual/audio assets
3. **Narrative/Content** - Quests, events, dialog trees, and story elements

While these groups are interdependent and cannot be developed in complete isolation, we structure development to minimize dependencies and maximize reusability.

## Phase 1: MVP Systems and Foundational Content

### Goal
Build minimal viable versions of all core systems with just enough content to validate functionality.

### Scope
- **Systems**: MVP implementations of all core mechanics
- **Assets**: Minimal set required for testing (player character, 2-3 districts, 5-10 NPCs)
- **Narrative**: Basic dialog examples and the "Intro Quest"

### Key Deliverables
- Working point-and-click navigation
- Basic NPC interaction framework
- Simple dialog system
- Minimal save/load functionality
- **Intro Quest** as vertical slice validation

### Content Templates Created
- **Template NPC**: Fully functional NPC with all states (IDLE, TALKING, SUSPICIOUS, HOSTILE)
- **Template District**: Complete district demonstrating walkable areas, exits, and interactive objects
- **Template Dialog Structure**: Reusable conversation patterns (greeting, topic branches, suspicion checks)
- **Template Interactive Object**: Base implementation for all interactive items

### Success Criteria
The Intro Quest can be completed using all MVP systems without major bugs or integration issues.

## Phase 2: Full Systems Development

### Goal
Expand MVP systems to their complete implementations while creating more sophisticated content examples.

### Scope
- **Systems**: Full implementations of all game mechanics
- **Assets**: Expand to 3-4 districts, 20-30 NPCs for testing
- **Narrative**: Complex dialog trees and the "First Quest"

### Key Deliverables
- Complete time management system
- Full suspicion mechanics
- Advanced dialog with branching
- Complete save system with event persistence
- Visual enhancements (perspective scaling, occlusion)
- Audio system implementation
- **First Quest** as comprehensive system test

### Expanded Templates
- **Complex NPC Behaviors**: NPCs with schedules, routines, and state persistence
- **Multi-room Districts**: Districts with sub-locations and complex navigation
- **Quest Templates**: Reusable patterns for different quest types
- **Event Templates**: Patterns for time-based and conditional events

### Success Criteria
The First Quest exercises all major systems and reveals any integration issues before full content creation.

## Phase 3: Full Content Implementation

### Goal
Create all narrative content and remaining assets using proven systems and templates.

### Scope
- **Systems**: Polish and optimization only (no new features)
- **Assets**: All 7 districts, ~150 NPCs, complete visual/audio assets
- **Narrative**: All quests, complete dialog trees, full event system

### Key Deliverables
- All 7 districts fully implemented
- Complete NPC roster with unique personalities
- Full quest implementation
- Complete dialog for all NPCs
- All endings implemented
- Final audio and visual polish

### Content Creation Workflow
1. **Quest Design**: Write all quest outlines and dialog trees
2. **Asset Requirements**: Identify exactly what assets each quest needs
3. **Batch Creation**: Create assets in logical groups (all Mall NPCs together, etc.)
4. **Integration**: Implement content using established templates
5. **Polish**: Final pass for consistency and quality

### Success Criteria
Full game is playable from start to any ending with all content implemented.

## Phase Transitions

### MVP to Full Systems
- **Trigger**: Successful completion of Intro Quest
- **Review Period**: 1 iteration for bug fixes and polish
- **Validation**: All MVP systems stable and extensible

### Full Systems to Content
- **Trigger**: Successful completion of First Quest
- **Review Period**: 1-2 iterations for system polish and optimization
- **Validation**: No major system changes needed

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Major technical challenges addressed early
2. **Efficient Content Creation**: Templates and patterns established before bulk content
3. **Reduced Rework**: Narrative content built on stable systems
4. **Clear Milestones**: Each phase has concrete validation points
5. **Flexible Scope**: Content phase can be adjusted without affecting core game

## Implementation Notes

- Each iteration should clearly state which phase it belongs to
- Phase 1 and 2 content is not throwaway - it appears in the final game
- Templates should be thoroughly documented for efficient reuse
- Regular playtesting at phase boundaries ensures quality

## Quest Validation Requirements

### Intro Quest (Phase 1 Validation)
**Required Systems**: Basic navigation, simple dialog, inventory, basic NPC interaction
**Required Assets**: 
- Spaceport (Docked Ship, Main Floor)
- Engineering (Science Deck)
- Barracks (Room 306, Main Floor)
- NPCs: Ship Stewardess, Science Lead 01, minimal others

### First Quest (Phase 2 Validation)
**Required Systems**: All core systems including time management, suspicion, complex puzzles
**Required Assets**:
- Barracks (full implementation)
- Security (Brig, Main Floor)
- Mall (multiple shops)
- Trading Floor (Bank)
- NPCs: Concierge, Bank Teller, Security Officers, Mall vendors, Resistance members
