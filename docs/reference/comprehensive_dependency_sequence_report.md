# Comprehensive Dependency Sequence Report
## A Silent Refraction - Full System Implementation Order

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes all design documents and iteration plans to provide a single, linear implementation sequence that respects all system dependencies. Since this is a one-person project, the sequence is designed as a strict Kanban-style workflow where each system builds upon previously completed work.

## Dependencies Not Yet Scheduled

The following design documents exist but are not explicitly scheduled in iterations:

### Template Documents (Reference Throughout):
1. **Template Integration Standards** â†’ Reference document for all iterations
2. **Template Interactive Object Design** â†’ Reference in Iteration 4 (UI Systems)
3. **Template NPC Design** â†’ Reference in Iteration 2 and 11
4. **Template Quest Design** â†’ Reference in Iteration 11

### Minor Systems Not Explicitly Listed:
1. **Puzzle System Design** â†’ Should be in Iteration 15 with Investigation
2. **Trading Floor Minigame System** â†’ Already in Iteration 16
3. **Main Menu/Start Game UI** â†’ Should be in Iteration 4

## Critical Path Dependencies

### Must Be Completed Before Phase 2:
1. Navigation and Camera (Iterations 1-3)
2. Time Management (Iteration 5)
3. Save System (Iteration 6)
4. Basic Economy (Iteration 7)

### Must Be Completed Before Phase 3:
1. All core systems (Iterations 1-18)
2. Assimilation mechanics (Iteration 13)
3. Multiple endings framework (Iteration 18)

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions for Current Iteration (3)
- Complete navigation refactoring with visual validation
- Implement audio system MVP (currently missing)
- Begin performance monitoring framework

### 2. Missing Critical Systems
All major systems have design documents. The sequence above includes all designs.

### 3. Parallel Work Opportunities (Limited)
Since this is a one-person project, true parallel work isn't possible. However, some tasks within iterations can be interleaved:
- Asset creation while waiting for builds
- Documentation while testing
- Design refinement during implementation

### 4. Risk Mitigation
- **Iteration 10**: Critical validation point - ensure Intro Quest works
- **Iteration 18**: Critical validation point - ensure First Quest works
- Build time buffers into Iterations 10 and 18 for fixes

### 5. Design Document Gaps
All major systems have design documents. The only gaps are:
- Specific minigame designs beyond Trading Floor
- Detailed environmental interaction patterns
- Combat system (intentionally excluded from design)

## Conclusion

This sequence provides a clear, dependency-respecting path from current state (Iteration 3) to complete game and distribution. Each iteration builds upon previous work with no forward dependencies. The three-phase approach (MVP â†’ Full Systems â†’ Content) minimizes rework and ensures stable foundations for content creation.

Key changes from original planning:
- Dialog System Refactoring remains in Iteration 6 (Phase 1) where it belongs
- Hardware Validation moved to new Iteration 24 (Phase 3) for post-release distribution
- Audio System MVP added to Iteration 3 (currently missing)
- Total iterations expanded from 23 to 24 to accommodate hardware distribution phase

The project is well-documented with 53 comprehensive design documents covering all major systems. Following this sequence will result in systematic progress toward a complete, polished, and distributable game.
