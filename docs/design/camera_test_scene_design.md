# Camera Test Scene Design Document

**Status: ðŸ“‹ DESIGN**  
**Target: Iteration 3, Task 3**  
**Created: May 22, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design for a comprehensive camera test scene that validates all camera system improvements while maintaining the aesthetic and practical nature of "A Silent Refraction". Rather than abstract test patterns, we use practical, in-game style environments that serve dual purposes: thorough technical validation and potential reuse as game assets.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Practical Over Abstract**: Test backgrounds should look like they belong in the game world
2. **Natural Integration**: Testing elements are incorporated into environmental storytelling
3. **Dual Purpose**: Test assets should be reusable for actual game content where possible
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every camera requirement must be testable through the scene
5. **Visual Clarity**: Issues should be immediately visible without breaking immersion

### Alignment with Game Aesthetic
Following the game design document's vision:
- Total Recall (1990): Industrial Mars colonization aesthetic
- Alien (1979): Isolated space station atmosphere
- Blade Runner (1982): Neon-lit dystopian elements
- SCUMM Games: Pixel art clarity and readability

## Implementation Guidelines

### Background Creation Process

1. **Canvas Setup**
   - Primary size: 4096x2048 pixels
   - Use only the 16-color canonical palette
   - Create at 1:1 pixel ratio (no anti-aliasing)

2. **Layering Strategy**
   - Background: Base environment structure
   - Midground: Interactive elements and details
   - Foreground: UI reference points and markers
   - Overlay: Testing indicators (toggleable)

3. **Technical Markers**
   - Embed naturally into environment
   - Ensure visibility without breaking immersion
   - Use environmental storytelling for reference points

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimize pattern complexity for rendering
   - Balance detail with performance requirements
   - Test on minimum specification hardware

## Conclusion

This camera test scene design provides comprehensive validation capabilities while maintaining the practical, immersive quality expected in "A Silent Refraction". By using in-world environments rather than abstract test patterns, we ensure that camera improvements work correctly in realistic game scenarios while providing developers with powerful testing tools.

The design supports the TDD methodology by making camera behaviors visually verifiable and immediately apparent, allowing for rapid iteration and confidence in system improvements.
