## Content Creation Guidelines

### NPC Creation Workflow
1. Define personality archetype
2. Create visual sprite variants
3. Write base dialog tree
4. Set daily schedule
5. Define trust relationships
6. Add gender-specific responses
7. Integrate with district events
8. Test all interactions

### Quest Design Process
1. Write quest outline
2. Define requirements (items, NPCs, locations)
3. Create branching paths
4. Set time constraints
5. Add failure conditions
6. Integrate with other systems
7. Place clues/items
8. Test all outcomes

### Dialog Writing Standards
- Keep exchanges concise (3-5 lines max)
- Use period-appropriate language
- Reflect character personality
- Include suspicion checks
- Add trust modifiers
- Create gender variations
- Maintain noir tone

## Asset Requirements

### Sprites Needed
- 150 unique NPC sprites (with animation sets)
- 7 district backgrounds (with time variations)
- ~100 interactive object sprites
- ~50 inventory item sprites
- UI element sprites
- Effect sprites (smoke, steam, etc.)

### Audio Assets
- 7 district ambiences
- ~50 diegetic music tracks
- ~100 UI sound effects
- ~200 environmental sounds
- Event audio stingers
- Tram system sounds

### Text Content
- ~10,000 lines of dialog
- ~500 item descriptions
- ~100 location descriptions
- ~50 quest descriptions
- Tutorial text (minimal)
- UI text and prompts

## Quality Benchmarks

### Per District
- Minimum 15 NPCs
- 3-5 job opportunities  
- 5-10 interactive objects
- 2-3 sub-locations
- Unique ambience
- District-specific events

### Per NPC
- Unique sprite and animations
- 50-100 lines of dialog
- Daily schedule
- 2-3 relationships
- Personal quest or role
- Gender-aware responses

### Per Quest
- Clear objectives
- Multiple solutions
- Meaningful rewards
- Failure conditions
- Time considerations
- System integration

## Risk Mitigation

### Content Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to designed systems only
- **Dialog Inconsistency**: Use style guide and templates
- **Asset Bottleneck**: Batch create similar assets
- **Balance Issues**: Regular playtesting cycles

### Technical Risks
- **Performance**: Profile with full content
- **Save File Size**: Monitor serialization growth
- **Memory Usage**: Implement asset streaming
- **Load Times**: Optimize district transitions

## Success Metrics

Phase 3 is complete when:
1. All 7 districts are fully populated and functional
2. ~150 NPCs have unique personalities and schedules
3. All quest types are implemented and completable
4. Full game playable start to any ending
5. Performance targets met with all content
6. No critical bugs in content progression
7. Polish pass completed on all assets

## Timeline Summary

**Total Duration**: 21-29 weeks (5-7 months)

1. **Core Foundation**: 4-6 weeks
2. **District Population**: 6-8 weeks  
3. **Quest Implementation**: 4-6 weeks
4. **Dialog/Narrative**: 4-5 weeks
5. **Polish/Integration**: 3-4 weeks

This assumes full-time development. Adjust timeline based on actual development capacity.
