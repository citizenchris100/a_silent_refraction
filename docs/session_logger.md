# Session Logger for A Silent Refraction

The Session Logger is a powerful tool designed to help you maintain continuity across development sessions. It allows you to track progress, manage tasks, and document your work in a structured, searchable format.

## Overview

When working on complex game development tasks, it's common to spread work across multiple sessions. The Session Logger helps you:

- Easily pick up where you left off
- Track task status and completion
- Maintain development notes and observations
- Connect tasks to specific code files
- Generate comprehensive session summaries
- Update the iteration progress file automatically

## Getting Started

### Installation

The Session Logger is included with the project in the `tools` directory. To install it for system-wide use:

```bash
./tools/session_logger.sh install
```

This will create a symbolic link to the script in `/usr/local/bin`, allowing you to use the command `session-logger` from anywhere.

### Basic Workflow

A typical development workflow with the Session Logger looks like this:

1. **Start a session** when you begin working
2. **Add tasks** you plan to work on
3. **Add notes** as you encounter issues or make discoveries
4. **Mark tasks as completed** as you finish them
5. **Link tasks to files** that you've modified
6. **End the session** when you're done, providing a summary

## Available Commands

### Managing Sessions

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `start` | Start a new development session | `./tools/session_logger.sh start` |
| `end` | End the current session | `./tools/session_logger.sh end` |
| `list` | List all development sessions | `./tools/session_logger.sh list` |
| `view [date]` | View a specific session | `./tools/session_logger.sh view 2025-05-12` |

### Task Management

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `add-task "description"` | Add a task to the current session | `./tools/session_logger.sh add-task "Implement scrolling camera"` |
| `complete-task <number>` | Mark a task as completed | `./tools/session_logger.sh complete-task 1` |
| `link-task <number> <file>` | Link a task to a specific file | `./tools/session_logger.sh link-task 1 "src/core/camera.gd"` |
| `update-progress "keyword"` | Update the iteration progress file | `./tools/session_logger.sh update-progress "camera"` |

### Session Content

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `add-note "content"` | Add a note to the current session | `./tools/session_logger.sh add-note "Found bug in camera implementation"` |
| `set-goal "description"` | Add a goal to the current session | `./tools/session_logger.sh set-goal "Complete scrolling camera system"` |

## Session Files

Session logs are stored in Markdown format in the `dev_logs/sessions` directory. They contain structured sections:

```markdown
# Development Session: Implement Scrolling Camera
**Date:** May 12, 2025
**Time:** 10:30:45
**Iteration:** 2
**Task Focus:** Camera System

## Session Goals
- Complete the scrolling camera implementation
- Test with different background sizes

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Create base scrolling camera class
  ▶ Related files: src/core/camera/scrolling_camera.gd
- [x] Modify district class to support camera
  ▶ Related files: src/core/districts/base_district.gd
- [ ] Add camera bounds validation

## Notes
- Found issue with camera positioning when background is centered
- Need to ensure camera bounds are respected at screen edges

## Next Steps
- Test with larger background images
- Add interpolation for smoother camera movement

## Time Log
- Started: 10:30:45
- Ended: 12:45:32

## Summary
Implemented basic scrolling camera system that follows player when they approach screen edges. Modified district system to support camera initialization and configuration.
```

## Integration with Iteration Progress

When you mark a task as completed, you'll be prompted to update the iteration progress file. This helps maintain synchronization between your session logs and the overall project progress.

The Session Logger can:

- Find matching tasks in the iteration progress file
- Update their status from "Pending" to "Complete"
- Show you available tasks if an exact match isn't found

## Tips for Effective Use

1. **Start Each Work Session with the Session Logger**
   ```bash
   ./tools/session_logger.sh start
   ```

2. **Add Tasks at the Beginning**
   Plan what you want to accomplish and add tasks before you start coding.
   ```bash
   ./tools/session_logger.sh add-task "Implement camera bounds"
   ./tools/session_logger.sh add-task "Add debug visualization"
   ```

3. **Link Tasks to Files as You Work**
   When you modify or create files, link them to the relevant task.
   ```bash
   ./tools/session_logger.sh link-task 1 "src/core/camera/scrolling_camera.gd"
   ```

4. **Add Notes About Challenges and Solutions**
   Document issues you encounter and how you solve them.
   ```bash
   ./tools/session_logger.sh add-note "Fixed camera jitter by updating position in _process instead of _physics_process"
   ```

5. **End Your Session with a Good Summary**
   When ending a session, provide a clear, concise summary of what you accomplished.

6. **Use `list` and `view` to Refer to Previous Sessions**
   ```bash
   ./tools/session_logger.sh list
   ./tools/session_logger.sh view 2025-05-10
   ```

## Advanced Usage

### Searching Session Logs

You can use standard command-line tools to search across all session logs:

```bash
# Search for all mentions of "camera" in session logs
grep -r "camera" dev_logs/sessions/

# Find all tasks related to a specific feature
grep -r "▶ Related files: src/core/camera" dev_logs/sessions/

# List all completed tasks
grep -r "- \[x\]" dev_logs/sessions/
```

### Updating the Iteration Progress File

While tasks are automatically linked to the iteration progress file when marked complete, you can also manually update it:

```bash
# Update a specific task in the iteration progress file
./tools/session_logger.sh update-progress "camera system"
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Session Logger:

- Ensure the log directory (`dev_logs/sessions`) exists
- Check file permissions (`chmod +x tools/session_logger.sh`)
- Verify that required dependencies (sed, grep) are installed
- Ensure the iteration progress file exists at the expected path

## Example: Complete Development Session

Here's an example of a full development session workflow:

```bash
# Start a new session
./tools/session_logger.sh start
# (enter session title, focus, and iteration number)

# Add session goals
./tools/session_logger.sh set-goal "Implement scrolling camera system"
./tools/session_logger.sh set-goal "Test with different background sizes"

# Add specific tasks
./tools/session_logger.sh add-task "Create base scrolling camera class"
./tools/session_logger.sh add-task "Modify district class to support camera"
./tools/session_logger.sh add-task "Add camera bounds validation"

# As you complete tasks, mark them and link to files
./tools/session_logger.sh complete-task 1
./tools/session_logger.sh link-task 1 "src/core/camera/scrolling_camera.gd"

./tools/session_logger.sh complete-task 2
./tools/session_logger.sh link-task 2 "src/core/districts/base_district.gd"

# Add notes about important discoveries
./tools/session_logger.sh add-note "Camera needs to respect screen size when calculating bounds"

# End the session with a summary
./tools/session_logger.sh end
# (enter summary of what was accomplished)
```

This creates a comprehensive record of your development session that you can refer back to later and helps ensure continuity between work sessions.
