## Detailed Progress

### Iteration 2: NPC Framework, Suspicion System, and Initial Asset Creation

**Goals:**
- Implement basic NPCs with interactive capabilities
- Create the suspicion system as a core gameplay mechanic
- Apply visual style guide to one area as a prototype
- Develop placeholder art generation for NPCs
- **B1:** Establish core game mechanic of NPC suspicion to drive gameplay tension
- **B2:** Create reusable NPC framework to streamline future character development
- **U1:** As a player, I want to observe subtle cues that help identify assimilated NPCs
- **U2:** As a player, I want to track my suspicion level with accessible UI
- **U3:** As a player, I want NPCs to feel distinct through dialog and behavior
- **T1:** Create extensible NPC state machine system
- [ ] Task 1: Create base NPC class with state machine
- [ ] Task 2: Implement NPC dialog system
- [ ] Task 3: Create suspicion meter UI element
- [ ] Task 4: Implement suspicion tracking system
- [ ] Task 5: Script NPC reactions based on suspicion levels
- [ ] Task 6: Apply visual style guide to Shipping District
- [ ] Task 7: Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders
- [ ] Task 8: Implement observation mechanics for detecting assimilated NPCs
- **Linked to:** B1, U2
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
- Use ProgressBar node as the base for the meter implementation
- Consider shader effects for visual polish (glowing, pulsing at high suspicion)
- Integrate with the global_suspicion_manager.gd for data binding
- NPCs can be interacted with using the verb system
- Suspicion level changes based on player actions
- Visual style matches the style guide specifications
- Observation mechanics work correctly
- Start date: 2025-05-16
- Target completion: 2025-05-30
- Iteration 1 (Basic Environment and Navigation)
