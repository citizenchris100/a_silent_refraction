**Tasks:**

| Task | Status | Linked Files |
|------|--------|--------------|
| Implement dialog service interfaces and dependency injection (As a developer, I want dialog services to use dependency injection instead of scene tree traversal, so that I can test dialog logic in isolation and eliminate tight coupling between systems.) | Pending | - |
| Create dialog data abstraction layer (DialogData, DialogNode classes) (As a developer, I want dialog data separated from UI and processing logic, so that I can modify dialog content without affecting system behavior and test dialog logic with predictable data.) | Pending | - |
| Refactor dialog processing with validation pipeline (As a developer, I want dialog processing to use a validation pipeline, so that I can catch errors early with structured context and extend validation rules without modifying core logic.) | Pending | - |

| Establish dialog signal-based event system (As a developer, I want dialog system communication to use signals instead of direct method calls, so that I can decouple dialog components and enable extensible event handling.) | Pending | - |
| Create comprehensive dialog unit tests and mocks (As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for the dialog system, so that I can prevent regressions and validate behavior changes during refactoring.) | Pending | - |
| Implement progressive dialog system migration with adapters (As a developer, I want to migrate the dialog system gradually without breaking existing functionality, so that I can refactor safely while maintaining system stability.) | Pending | - |
| Implement verb service interfaces and configuration system (As a developer, I want verb definitions to be configurable and verb processing to use service interfaces, so that I can add new verbs easily and test interaction logic without full UI dependencies.) | Pending | - |
| Create interaction processing pipeline (validators/processors) (As a developer, I want verb interactions to use a validation and processing pipeline, so that I can add new interaction rules without modifying core logic and handle edge cases consistently.) | Pending | - |
| Refactor verb UI with factory pattern and controller separation (As a developer, I want verb UI creation separated from interaction logic, so that I can test UI behavior independently and support different UI themes without affecting core interaction processing.) | Pending | - |
| Establish verb interaction event bus and signal architecture (As a developer, I want verb system communication to use signals instead of direct method calls, so that I can decouple interaction components and enable extensible event handling for interactions.) | Pending | - |

| Validate 100% functional parity with original systems (As a player, I want all dialog and verb interactions to work exactly as they did before the refactoring, so that my gameplay experience is unaffected by internal system improvements.) | Pending | - |
| Update system documentation for both refactored systems (As a developer, I want updated documentation for both refactored systems, so that I can understand the new architecture and maintain the systems effectively in the future.) | Pending | - |
