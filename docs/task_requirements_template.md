# Task Requirements Template

## Requirements Section for Tasks (User Stories)

The following template should be used to enhance task definitions with proper user story requirements. This format should be incorporated into the iteration_planner.sh script to automatically generate the structure when creating new tasks.

```markdown
### Task X: [Task Title]

**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature/capability], so that [benefit/value].

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** [List of related Epic-level requirements, e.g., B1, U2]
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. [Specific condition that must be met]
  2. [Specific condition that must be met]
  3. [Specific condition that must be met]

**Implementation Notes:**
- [Technical guidance, approach, or constraints]
- [References to existing code/systems to leverage]
```

## Example for a Task in Iteration 2

```markdown
### Task 3: Create suspicion meter UI element

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see a visual indicator of my current suspicion level, so that I can make informed decisions about my actions and interactions with NPCs.

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B1, U2
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Suspicion meter is clearly visible in the game UI
  2. Meter visually changes as suspicion level increases/decreases
  3. Critical thresholds are visually distinct (safe, caution, danger)
  4. Meter updates in real-time when player performs suspicious actions
  5. Visual design matches the game's dystopian sci-fi aesthetic

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use ProgressBar node as the base for the meter implementation
- Consider shader effects for visual polish (glowing, pulsing at high suspicion)
- Integrate with the global_suspicion_manager.gd for data binding
```

## Integration with Iteration Requirements

When updating the iteration_planner.sh script, ensure that:

1. Each task can reference one or more requirements from the Iteration-level requirements section
2. Tasks use consistent formatting for user stories: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
3. Each task includes specific acceptance criteria that can be tested
4. Implementation notes are optional but encouraged for complex tasks

## Implementation Approach

The task requirements should be formatted to work well with the existing progress tracking in the iteration_planner.sh script, allowing the requirements and acceptance criteria to be included in reports and progress summaries.
