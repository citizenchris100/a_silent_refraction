### Task 11: Implement observation mechanics for detecting assimilated NPCs

**User Story:** As a player, I want to carefully observe NPCs for subtle clues that indicate they have been assimilated, so that I can identify threats and make informed decisions about whom to trust and recruit.

**Status History:**
- **‚úÖ COMPLETE** (05/22/25)
**Status History:**
- **üîÑ IN PROGRESS** (05/22/25)
**Status History:**
- **‚úÖ COMPLETE** (05/22/25)
**Status History:**
- **‚è≥ PENDING** (05/22/25)
**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B1, U1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. NPCs exhibit different subtle behavioral cues based on assimilation status
  2. Assimilated NPCs have visual tells that are discoverable through careful observation
  3. Player can access a dedicated "observe" mode that enables closer inspection of NPCs
  4. Different observation levels reveal different levels of information (casual glance vs. intense scrutiny)
  5. Successful observation adds information to the assimilated NPC tracking log
  6. False positives are possible to create tension and uncertainty
  7. Observation mechanics integrate with the suspicion system (being caught observing raises suspicion)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Create a sliding scale of observation intensity with corresponding information reveals
- Design subtle visual cues that fit the game's aesthetic (slight color shifts, animation differences)
- Balance difficulty so observation feels like skilled detective work but not frustratingly obscure
- Link with existing suspicion and NPC state systems from Iteration 2

### Task 12: Set up Raspberry Pi 5 hardware validation environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set up a complete Raspberry Pi 5 testing environment, so that I can validate our game's performance on the actual target hardware before committing to the gaming appliance distribution strategy

**Status History:**
- **‚è≥ PENDING** (05/22/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** [List related Epic-level requirements]
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. [Specific condition that must be met]

**Implementation Notes:**
- [Technical guidance or approach]

### Task 13: Conduct POC performance testing on target hardware

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to conduct comprehensive performance testing of the complete POC on Raspberry Pi 5 hardware, so that I can identify any optimization needs and confirm the viability of our gaming appliance approach

**Status History:**
- **‚è≥ PENDING** (05/22/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** [List related Epic-level requirements]
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. [Specific condition that must be met]

**Implementation Notes:**
