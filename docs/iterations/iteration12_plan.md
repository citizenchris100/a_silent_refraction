# Iteration 12: Assimilation and Coalition

## Epic Description
**Phase**: 2 - Full Systems  
**Cohesive Goal**: "The station reacts to assimilation with resistance and multiple endings"

As a player, I experience a living station where the mysterious assimilation spreads dynamically, security responds to threats, and I can build a coalition of allies to fight back, ultimately determining one of multiple possible endings based on my choices.

## Goals
- Implement full Assimilation System with spread mechanics
- Build Coalition/Resistance System for fighting back
- Create Crime/Security Event System
- Develop Multiple Endings Framework
- Establish dynamic world state
- Create emergent narrative possibilities

## Requirements

  - **Success Metric:** Station security and NPCs adapt to assimilation spread

- **B2:** Enable multiple story outcomes through coalition mechanics
  - **Rationale:** Player agency in story resolution increases satisfaction
  - **Success Metric:** At least 5 distinct endings based on player choices

- **B3:** Implement crime and security dynamics
  - **Rationale:** Actions should have consequences in a believable world
  - **Success Metric:** Security responds appropriately to criminal activities

### User Requirements
