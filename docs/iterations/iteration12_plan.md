# Iteration 12: Assimilation and Coalition

## Epic Description
**Phase**: 2 - Full Systems  
**Cohesive Goal**: "The station reacts to assimilation with resistance and multiple endings"

As a player, I experience a living station where the mysterious assimilation spreads dynamically, security responds to threats, and I can build a coalition of allies to fight back, ultimately determining one of multiple possible endings based on my choices.

## Goals
- Implement full Assimilation System with spread mechanics
- Build Coalition/Resistance System for fighting back
- Create Crime/Security Event System
- Develop Multiple Endings Framework
- Establish dynamic world state
- Create emergent narrative possibilities

## Requirements

### Business Requirements
- **B1:** Create dynamic station response to assimilation threat
  - **Rationale:** Living world that reacts to events increases immersion
  - **Success Metric:** Station security and NPCs adapt to assimilation spread

- **B2:** Enable multiple story outcomes through coalition mechanics
  - **Rationale:** Player agency in story resolution increases satisfaction
  - **Success Metric:** At least 5 distinct endings based on player choices

- **B3:** Implement crime and security dynamics
  - **Rationale:** Actions should have consequences in a believable world
  - **Success Metric:** Security responds appropriately to criminal activities

### User Requirements
- **U1:** As a player, I want the station to react to the assimilation threat
  - **User Value:** Dynamic world feels alive and responsive
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Security increases and NPCs change behavior as threat grows

- **U2:** As a player, I want to build a coalition to fight back
  - **User Value:** Leadership gameplay provides agency
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Can recruit allies and influence the ending

- **U3:** As a player, I want my choices to determine the outcome
  - **User Value:** Meaningful consequences for decisions
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Different approaches lead to different endings

### Technical Requirements
- **T1:** Design assimilation spread algorithm
  - **Rationale:** Spread must feel organic but be controllable
  - **Constraints:** Must be deterministic for save/load

- **T2:** Create faction system architecture
  - **Rationale:** Multiple groups with competing interests
  - **Constraints:** Handle complex inter-faction relationships

- **T3:** Implement ending determination logic
  - **Rationale:** Multiple factors influence final outcome
  - **Constraints:** Clear but not obvious ending triggers

## User Stories

### Task 2: Implement infection spread mechanics
**User Story:** As the assimilation force, I want to spread through the station population strategically, so that the player faces an evolving and escalating threat.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B1, U1, T1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Infection spreads through close contact
  2. Different NPCs have different resistance
  3. Spread rate affected by security measures
  4. Player actions can slow/accelerate spread
  5. Visual progression of infection stages

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reference: docs/design/assimilation_system_design.md
- Spread factors: proximity, time, resistance, security
- Stages: Exposed → Infected → Assimilated
- Consider "patient zero" mechanics

### Task 7: Implement recruitment mechanics
**User Story:** As a player, I want to convince NPCs to join the resistance, so that I can build a force capable of fighting the assimilation threat.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B2, U2, T2
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Recruitment based on trust levels
  2. Different NPCs bring different skills
  3. Failed recruitment has consequences
  4. Coalition members can be lost
  5. Size affects available actions

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reference: docs/design/coalition_resistance_system_design.md
- Skills: Combat, Medical, Technical, Leadership
- Maximum coalition size: 20 active members
- Consider betrayal mechanics

### Task 13: Build security alert levels
**User Story:** As station security, I want to escalate our response based on threat levels, so that we maintain order while adapting to the growing crisis.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B3, U1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Alert levels: Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, Lockdown
  2. Each level has specific restrictions
  3. Player actions influence alert level
  4. Visual/audio indicators for each level
  5. NPC behavior changes with alerts

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reference: docs/design/crime_security_event_system_design.md
- Green: Normal operations
- Lockdown: Martial law, shoot on sight
- Consider evacuation scenarios

### Task 17: Define ending conditions
**User Story:** As a player, I want my accumulated choices to lead to a meaningful conclusion, so that my journey feels complete and consequential.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B2, U3, T3
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. At least 5 distinct endings
  2. Clear but not obvious triggers
  3. Ending reflects major choices
  4. Some endings have variations
  5. New game+ considerations

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reference: docs/design/multiple_endings_system_design.md
- Endings: Total Assimilation, Pyrrhic Victory, True Victory, Escape, Sacrifice
- Track: Coalition strength, Assimilation %, Key decisions
- Consider epilogue variations

## Testing Criteria
- Assimilation spreads believably
- Coalition mechanics function properly
- Security responds appropriately
- Endings trigger correctly
- All systems affect world state
- Save/load preserves all states
- Performance with many active systems
- Emergent scenarios feel natural

## Timeline
- Start date: After Iteration 11
- Target completion: 3 weeks (complex interactions)
