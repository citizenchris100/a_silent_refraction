# Iteration 12: Assimilation and Coalition

## Epic Description
**Phase**: 2 - Full Systems  
**Cohesive Goal**: "The station reacts to assimilation with resistance and multiple endings"

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Minimize redundant data
  2. Short keys for common fields
  3. Only save non-defaults
  4. Compress arrays efficiently
  5. Under 1MB for full game

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reference: docs/design/assimilation_system_design.md
- Single letter type indicators
- Omit empty fields
- Batch similar data

### Task 58: Build version migration support
**User Story:** As a developer, I want old save files to upgrade gracefully, so that players don't lose progress when we update the assimilation system.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (06/01/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** T1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Version tracking in saves
  2. Migration function support
  3. V1 to V2 migration path
  4. Graceful handling of missing data
  5. No data loss on upgrade

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reference: docs/design/assimilation_system_design.md
- MVP = version 1
- Full = version 2
- Add missing fields with defaults

### Task 59: Add differential serialization
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to save only changed assimilation data, so that save operations are fast even with many NPCs.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (06/01/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** T1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Track state changes
  2. Delta saves implemented
  3. Full saves periodically
  4. Reconstruction reliable
  5. Corruption detection

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reference: docs/design/assimilation_system_design.md
- Reference: docs/design/modular_serialization_architecture.md
- Delta every save
- Full save every 10th

### Task 60: Create save/load integration tests
**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for serialization, so that save/load bugs are caught before release.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (06/01/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** T1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Test all data structures
  2. Test compression/decompression
  3. Test version migration
  4. Test corruption handling
  5. Test performance at scale

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reference: docs/design/assimilation_system_design.md
- 100+ NPC test cases
- Corruption injection tests
- Performance benchmarks

## Testing Criteria
- Assimilation spreads believably
- Coalition mechanics function properly
- Security responds appropriately
- Endings trigger correctly
- All systems affect world state
- Save/load preserves all states
- Performance with many active systems
- Emergent scenarios feel natural
- Event chains trigger and resolve correctly
- NPCs maintain consistent state machines
- Rumors propagate with appropriate distortion
- Evidence spawns and decays properly
- Reaction chains create logical consequences
- 100+ NPCs perform without frame drops
- Quantum NPCs transition smoothly
- Reputation affects NPC interactions
- Differential saves remain small and fast
- Emergent narratives feel coherent
- Leader/drone behaviors are distinct and appropriate
- Economic warfare reduces station value correctly
- Drone crimes trigger and affect districts
- Financial anomalies are detectable
- Speech pattern slips occur at correct frequencies
- Investigation mechanics reveal assimilation
- Coordinated crimes overwhelm security
- Behavioral degradation progresses naturally
- Assimilation serialization handles all data
- Version migration preserves save integrity

## Timeline
- Start date: After Iteration 11
- Target completion: 3 weeks (complex interactions)
- Critical for: Complete game experience

## Dependencies
- Iteration 11: Quest system (for coalition missions)
- Iteration 10: NPC relationships (for recruitment)
- Iteration 9: Detection system (for security)

- Player agency in determining outcome is key
- Systems create emergent storytelling opportunities
- Multiple endings encourage replay
- Living World Full adds complex event chains and emergent behaviors
- Assimilation System now fully implements the "economic horror" concept
- Two-tier hierarchy creates both subtle and obvious threats
