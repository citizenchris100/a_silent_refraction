# Iteration 9: Full Audio System Implementation

## Goals
- Complete the comprehensive diegetic audio system building on Iteration 3's MVP foundation
- Implement district-specific audio environments with smooth transitions
- Add advanced spatial audio features including stereo panning and environmental effects
- Create interactive audio elements and atmospheric sound design
- Establish production pipeline for audio content creation and management

## Requirements

### Business Requirements

- **B1:** Deliver a fully immersive diegetic audio experience where all sounds originate from identifiable in-world sources, reinforcing the game's atmosphere of corporate sterility masking creeping dread.
  - **Rationale:** Audio is crucial for establishing the game's unique atmosphere and supporting the narrative themes
  - **Success Metric:** All audio sources are visually identifiable or logically placed within the game world

- **B2:** Create district-specific audio environments that enhance the unique character and purpose of each station area through carefully designed soundscapes.
  - **Rationale:** Each district needs a distinct audio identity to aid navigation and reinforce its purpose
  - **Success Metric:** Players can identify districts by audio cues alone; each district feels sonically unique

- **B3:** Implement audio as a gameplay element where sound provides narrative context, environmental storytelling, and subtle cues about the assimilation threat.
  - **Rationale:** Audio should not just be atmospheric but actively contribute to gameplay and storytelling
  - **Success Metric:** Players report using audio cues for gameplay decisions; audio enhances narrative immersion

### User Requirements

- **U1:** As a player, I want all music and sounds to come from realistic sources in the game world (radios, PA systems, machinery), so the station feels like a real, functioning space.
  - **User Value:** Enhances immersion and makes the station feel lived-in and authentic
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Every sound has a visible or logical source; players can interact with some audio sources

- **U2:** As a player, I want spatial audio that accurately reflects my position relative to sound sources, so I can use audio cues to navigate and understand my environment.
  - **User Value:** Creates realistic spatial awareness and enables audio-based gameplay
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Audio pans correctly left/right; volume attenuates naturally with distance

- **U3:** As a player, I want the audio atmosphere to subtly change as more of the station becomes assimilated, creating an increasingly unsettling soundscape.
  - **User Value:** Audio reinforces the narrative tension and provides feedback on game state
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Cheerful muzak degrades over time; silence becomes more prevalent in assimilated areas

### Technical Requirements
- **T1:** Maintain 60 FPS performance with 20+ simultaneous audio sources using efficient LOD and pooling systems.
  - **Rationale:** Audio system must not impact gameplay performance
  - **Constraints:** Target hardware includes lower-spec machines; Godot 3.5.2 audio limitations

- **T2:** Build upon the MVP foundation from Iteration 3, extending all systems without breaking existing functionality.
  - **Rationale:** Ensures continuity and prevents regression of working features
  - **Constraints:** Must maintain compatibility with existing AudioManager and DiegeticAudioController

## Notes
This iteration implements the comprehensive audio system as designed in:
- docs/design/audio_system_technical_implementation.md (Full implementation plan)
- docs/design/audio_system_iteration3_mvp.md (MVP foundation reference)
- docs/reference/game_design_document.md (Audio Design section)

Key architectural decisions:
- All audio must be diegetic (Design Pillar #13)
- Music aesthetic should be "corporate banality" (Mallsoft/Vaporwave inspired)
- District-specific ambience creates unique atmospheres
- Performance optimization is critical for lower-spec hardware
- System builds on MVP without breaking existing functionality

### Task 1: Expand audio bus structure for district-specific routing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive audio bus hierarchy that supports district-specific mixing and effects, so that each area can have its unique sonic character.

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B2, T1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Expand bus structure to include district-specific buses (Mall_Music, Spaceport_Music, etc.)
  2. Configure appropriate effects chains for each district
  3. Set up routing for smooth cross-fading between districts
  4. Document bus architecture for future expansion
  5. Maintain performance with complex routing

**Implementation Notes:**
- Build on MVP's basic bus structure (Master -> Music, Ambience, SFX)
- Add per-district sub-buses under Music and Ambience
- Configure reverb, EQ, and compression per district
- Reference: docs/design/audio_system_technical_implementation.md - Section 1

### Task 6: Create stereo panning system using AudioEffectPanner

**User Story:** As a player, I want sounds to pan left and right based on their position relative to me, so that I can spatially locate audio sources in the game world.

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** U2, B1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Implement dynamic stereo panning based on horizontal position
  2. Panning integrates smoothly with distance attenuation
  3. Works correctly at all camera zoom levels
  4. Configurable pan width for different audio types
  5. No audible artifacts during rapid position changes

**Implementation Notes:**
- Godot 3.5.2 lacks built-in 2D panning, must implement via AudioEffectPanner
- Calculate pan value from relative X position
- Apply to appropriate audio buses dynamically
- Reference: docs/design/audio_system_technical_implementation.md - DiegeticAudioController

### Task 9: Create DistrictAudioConfig resource system

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a resource-based configuration system for district audio, so that sound designers can easily customize each area without code changes.

- Include properties for sources, volumes, effects parameters
- Design for visual editing in Godot
- Reference: docs/design/audio_system_technical_implementation.md - Section 4

### Task 14: Implement interactive audio objects (radios, PA systems)

**User Story:** As a player, I want to interact with audio sources like radios and PA systems, so that I have control over the soundscape and can discover audio-based secrets.

- Store audio state in object properties
- Reference: Design Pillar #13 - All music is diegetic

### Task 15: Create assimilation-based audio degradation system

**User Story:** As a player, I want the audio atmosphere to subtly degrade as assimilation spreads, so that I can feel the station's decline through sound.

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** U3, B3
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Music becomes distorted/glitchy in highly assimilated areas
  2. Ambient sounds fade or skip in affected districts
  3. Degradation level tied to district assimilation percentage
  4. Sudden silences create tension
  5. System integrates with game state manager

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add distortion effects dynamically based on assimilation level
- Implement random audio dropouts and glitches
- Create "broken speaker" effect for failing audio sources
- Tie to global game state tracking
