**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Hours:** 12

**Description:**  
Implement tram transportation system for fast travel between districts with schedule integration.

**User Story:**  
*As a player, I want to use the tram system to quickly travel between districts while seeing the world from a different perspective, making exploration more efficient.*

**Design Reference:** `docs/design/tram_transportation_system_design.md`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tram stations in each district
- [ ] Schedule-based arrivals
- [ ] Transition scenes during travel
- [ ] Integration with time system
- [ ] Access control validation

**Dependencies:**
- District system (Iteration 8)
- Time management (Iteration 5)
- Access control (Iteration 9)

### 5. Performance Optimization
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Hours:** 16

**Description:**  
Profile and optimize all systems to achieve stable 60 FPS performance on target hardware.

**User Story:**  
*As a player, I want smooth, responsive gameplay without stutters or slowdowns, so that I can stay immersed in the experience.*

**Design Reference:** `docs/design/performance_optimization_plan.md`

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Performance profiling completed
- [ ] Rendering optimizations implemented
- [ ] Object pooling for common objects
- [ ] Memory usage optimized
- [ ] Stable 60 FPS achieved

**Dependencies:**
- All previous systems
- Hardware validation (Iteration 1)

### 6. System Integration Validation
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Hours:** 12

**Description:**  
Comprehensive testing and validation of all systems working together without conflicts.

**User Story:**  
*As a developer, I want all systems to integrate seamlessly without conflicts or bugs, so that content creators can build on a stable foundation.*

**Acceptance Criteria:**
