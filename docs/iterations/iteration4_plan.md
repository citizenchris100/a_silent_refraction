# Iteration 4: Serialization Foundation

## Epic Description
**Phase**: 1 - MVP Foundation  
**Cohesive Goal**: "I can save and load game state"

- Establish save/load testing framework
- Document serialization patterns for future systems
- Enable compressed save file format

## Requirements

### Business Requirements
