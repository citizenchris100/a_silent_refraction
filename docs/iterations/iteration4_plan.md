# Iteration 4: Serialization Foundation

## Epic Description
**Phase**: 1 - MVP Foundation  
**Cohesive Goal**: "I can save and load game state"

As a developer, I need a robust serialization system that allows all game systems to save and restore their state. This foundational system will enable save/load functionality and ensure game state persistence across sessions.

## Goals
- Implement modular serialization architecture
- Create self-registering serialization system for all game components
- Establish save/load testing framework
- Document serialization patterns for future systems
- Enable compressed save file format

## Requirements

### Business Requirements
- **B1:** Create a sense of progression and urgency through time management
  - **Rationale:** Time-based gameplay creates strategic choices and replay value
  - **Success Metric:** Players report making meaningful time allocation decisions in test sessions

- **B2:** Expand game world with multiple distinct areas
  - **Rationale:** Diverse environments increase perceived game size and exploration value
  - **Success Metric:** Each district has unique visual identity and gameplay purpose

### User Requirements
- **U1:** As a player, I want to manage my time to prioritize activities
  - **User Value:** Creates strategic decision-making and consequences

### Technical Requirements
- **T1:** Implement modular serialization architecture
  - **Rationale:** Self-registering systems reduce coupling and maintenance burden
  - **Constraints:** Must support versioning for save compatibility

- **T2:** Use Godot's native serialization capabilities efficiently
  - **Rationale:** Leveraging engine features reduces complexity
  - **Constraints:** Must handle custom resources and node references

- **T3:** Implement save file compression
  - **Rationale:** Reduces storage requirements and improves load times
