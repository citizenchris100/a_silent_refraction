# Iteration 4: Serialization Foundation

## Epic Description
**Phase**: 1 - MVP Foundation  
**Cohesive Goal**: "I can save and load game state"

As a developer, I need a robust serialization system that allows all game systems to save and restore their state. This foundational system will enable save/load functionality and ensure game state persistence across sessions.

## Goals
- Implement modular serialization architecture
- Create self-registering serialization system for all game components
- Establish save/load testing framework
- Document serialization patterns for future systems
- Enable compressed save file format

## Requirements

### Business Requirements
- **B1:** Create a sense of progression and urgency through time management
  - **Rationale:** Time-based gameplay creates strategic choices and replay value
  - **Success Metric:** Players report making meaningful time allocation decisions in test sessions

- **B2:** Expand game world with multiple distinct areas
  - **Rationale:** Diverse environments increase perceived game size and exploration value
  - **Success Metric:** Each district has unique visual identity and gameplay purpose

### User Requirements
- **U1:** As a player, I want to manage my time to prioritize activities
  - **User Value:** Creates strategic decision-making and consequences
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Different actions consume varying amounts of in-game time

- **U2:** As a player, I want to explore distinct areas of the station
  - **User Value:** Provides variety and discovery
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Each district has unique visuals, NPCs, and activities

### Technical Requirements
- **T1:** Implement modular serialization architecture
  - **Rationale:** Self-registering systems reduce coupling and maintenance burden
  - **Constraints:** Must support versioning for save compatibility

- **T2:** Use Godot's native serialization capabilities efficiently
  - **Rationale:** Leveraging engine features reduces complexity
  - **Constraints:** Must handle custom resources and node references

- **T3:** Implement save file compression
  - **Rationale:** Reduces storage requirements and improves load times
  - **Constraints:** Compression must not significantly impact save/load performance

## User Stories

### Task 1: Create SerializationManager singleton
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a central serialization manager, so that all game systems can save and load their state through a unified interface.

**Design Reference:** `docs/design/modular_serialization_architecture.md`

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B1, T1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. SerializationManager exists as autoload singleton
  2. Provides register(), save(), and load() methods
  3. Handles file I/O operations safely
  4. Includes error handling and validation
  5. Supports multiple save slots (future expansion)

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use Godot's autoload system for singleton
- Implement using GDScript for consistency
- Store saves in user://saves/ directory
- Use .save extension for save files

### Task 3: Create self-registration system for serializable components
**User Story:** As a game system, I want to register myself for serialization automatically, so that adding new systems doesn't require modifying the save system.

**Design Reference:** `docs/design/modular_serialization_architecture.md`, `docs/design/serialization_system.md`

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** T1, T2
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Systems can call register_serializable(self) on ready
  2. Registration handles duplicates gracefully
  3. Supports categorization by system type
  4. Maintains weak references to prevent memory leaks
  5. Provides debugging tools to list registered systems

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use weak references (weakref) to prevent circular dependencies
- Implement categories: "core", "npc", "district", "ui", "gameplay"
- Add debug command to list all registered systems
- Consider using signals for registration events

### Task 5: Create compressed save file format
**User Story:** As a player, I want my save files to be small and load quickly, so that I don't waste disk space or time.

**Design Reference:** `docs/design/serialization_system.md`

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** T3
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Save files are compressed using zlib
  2. Compression reduces file size by >50%
  3. Load time remains under 2 seconds
  4. File format includes header with version info
  5. Corruption detection via checksum

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use Godot's built-in compression (File.COMPRESSION_ZSTD)
- Include metadata header before compressed data
- Implement CRC32 checksum for integrity
- Consider chunked compression for very large saves

## Testing Criteria
- SerializationManager successfully saves and loads game state
- All registered systems persist their data correctly
- Save files are compressed and validate properly
- Backwards compatibility is maintained
- Performance targets are met (save <1s, load <2s)
- Save system handles errors gracefully
- Unit tests achieve >90% coverage

## Timeline
- Start date: TBD
- Target completion: 2 weeks from start
- Critical for: Iteration 5 (Time System) and Iteration 7 (Save/Sleep)

## Dependencies
- Iteration 2: NPC Framework (need base classes to serialize)
- Iteration 3: Navigation System (completed - provides stable systems to test with)

## Code Links
- src/core/serialization/serialization_manager.gd (to be created)
- src/core/serialization/iserializable.gd (to be created)
- docs/design/modular_serialization_architecture.md
- docs/design/serialization_system.md

## Notes
- This iteration was reorganized from the original plan to establish serialization first
- Critical foundation for save/sleep system in Iteration 7
- Self-registration pattern reduces coupling and maintenance
- Consider save file encryption for future anti-cheat measures
