# Iteration 3: Game Districts and Time Management

## Goals
- Implement multiple station districts with transitions
- Create detailed time management system (Persona-style)
- Develop day/night cycle and time progression
- Implement random NPC assimilation tied to time
- Implement single-slot save system
- Create basic limited inventory system

## Requirements

### Business Requirements
- **B1:** Create a sense of progression and urgency through time management
  - **Rationale:** Time-based gameplay creates strategic choices and replay value
  - **Success Metric:** Players report making meaningful time allocation decisions in test sessions

- **B2:** Expand game world with multiple distinct areas
  - **Rationale:** Diverse environments increase perceived game size and exploration value
  - **Success Metric:** Each district has unique visual identity and gameplay purpose

### User Requirements
- **U1:** As a player, I want to manage my time to prioritize activities
  - **User Value:** Creates strategic decision-making and consequences
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Different actions consume varying amounts of in-game time

- **U2:** As a player, I want to explore distinct areas of the station
  - **User Value:** Provides variety and discovery
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Each district has unique visuals, NPCs, and activities

### Technical Requirements (Optional)
- **T1:** Implement robust scene transition system
  - **Rationale:** District loading and transitions must be seamless
  - **Constraints:** Must preserve game state across transitions

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Task 2: Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Task 3: Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Task 4: Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Task 5: Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Task 6: Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Task 7: Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Task 8: Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Task 9: Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Task 10: Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Task 11: Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Testing Criteria
- Player can travel between at least two districts
- Time advances through specific actions (tram travel, conversations, etc.)
- Day advances when player sleeps
- NPCs change status (assimilated/not) over time
- Player can save game by returning to their room
- Player has limited inventory space
