### Task 1: Enhance scrolling camera system with improved coordinate conversions

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game camera to track my character smoothly and accurately, so that I can focus on gameplay rather than managing my view of the action.

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B1, U1, T1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Camera follows player character smoothly without jerky movements
  2. Screen-to-world and world-to-screen coordinate conversions work accurately at all zoom levels
  3. Camera maintains proper boundaries based on the current district
  4. Edge case handling prevents camera from showing areas outside the playable space
  5. Camera movement uses appropriate easing for natural feel

**Implementation Notes:**
- Refine coordinate handling in scrolling_camera.gd
- Add validation methods to ensure coordinates are always valid
- Update camera targeting to prevent edge cases
- Maintain alignment with signal-based architectural pattern

### Task 4: Enhance player controller for consistent physics behavior

**User Story:** As a player, I want my character to move naturally with smooth acceleration and deceleration, so that navigation feels responsive and realistic.

  1. Character accelerates smoothly when starting movement
  2. Character decelerates naturally when approaching destination
  3. Movement state transitions are visually apparent and logical
