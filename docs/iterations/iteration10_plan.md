## User Stories

### Task 2: Implement trust level mechanics
**User Story:** As a player, I want my actions to build or destroy trust with NPCs, so that my choices have meaningful social consequences throughout the game.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B1, U1, T1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Trust levels: Hostile (-100), Suspicious (-50), Neutral (0), Friendly (50), Trusted (100)
  2. Actions modify trust incrementally
  3. Trust affects available dialog options
  4. Trust changes trigger NPC reactions
  5. Trust persists across sessions

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reference: docs/design/npc_trust_relationship_system_design.md
- Trust changes: Help (+10), Betray (-30), Small talk (+2)
- Consider trust decay over time without interaction
- Different NPCs have different trust gain rates

### Task 8: Implement memory system for NPCs
**User Story:** As an NPC, I want to remember my interactions with the player, so that our relationship feels continuous and meaningful across multiple encounters.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B3, T1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. NPCs remember last 10 interactions
  2. Memory affects future dialog
  3. Significant events never forgotten
  4. Memories can be shared between NPCs
  5. Memory saves with game state

**Implementation Notes:**
- Memory types: Interactions, Promises, Betrayals, Shared_Events
- Use circular buffer for recent memories
- Flag important memories as permanent
- Consider "gossip" system for memory sharing

### Task 14: Implement need-based behaviors
**User Story:** As an NPC, I want to fulfill my basic needs throughout the day, so that my routine feels natural and provides opportunities for player interaction.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B3, U3
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Needs: Hunger, Rest, Social, Work, Entertainment
  2. Needs drive routine priorities
  3. Unfulfilled needs affect mood
  4. Player can help fulfill needs
  5. Needs create predictable patterns

**Implementation Notes:**
- Need levels: 0-100, decay at different rates
- Activities fulfill specific needs
- Emergency behaviors when needs critical
- Reference: Living world design docs

### Task 18: Build identity verification mechanics
**User Story:** As a player in disguise, I want to pass identity checks through various means, so that infiltration requires preparation and quick thinking.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B2, U2, T2
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. ID checks at security points
