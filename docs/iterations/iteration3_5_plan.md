## Notes
This iteration establishes the core animation framework that will be used throughout the game to create dynamic, responsive environments. By implementing the animation systems before full district development, we ensure consistent animation capabilities across all game areas.

The tram system animations serve as the primary test case, as they connect all districts and involve both large-scale animations (tram arrival/departure) and smaller interactive elements (status displays, door mechanisms). This approach allows us to validate the animation framework with a critical game system.

The animation asset pipeline extensions build on our existing Midjourney/RunwayML workflow, adding specialized processing for animation sequences and optimizing them for in-game use. This streamlined pipeline will significantly reduce the time required to create and implement new animated elements.

Performance optimization is a key focus, ensuring that even densely animated areas maintain acceptable framerates on target hardware. The animation culling and quality scaling systems will dynamically adjust animation complexity based on player proximity and system performance.
