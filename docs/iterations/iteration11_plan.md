## Notes
- Quest system must be flexible for Phase 3 content
- Jobs provide both gameplay and narrative opportunities
- Disguise role obligations create "double-edged sword" gameplay where access requires responsibility
- Role performance and reputation systems add depth to infiltration mechanics
- First Quest validates all Phase 2 systems including disguise obligations
- Multiple solution paths encourage replay
- This iteration enables structured gameplay progression
- Trading Floor minigame provides economic job gameplay
- All job systems should integrate with the quest framework
- Disguise obligations fundamentally change infiltration from passive to active gameplay
