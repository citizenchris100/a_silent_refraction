# Iteration 14: Visual Polish Systems

## Epic Description
**Phase**: 2 - Full Systems  
**Cohesive Goal**: "The game looks polished with perspective and occlusion"

- Complete Foreground Occlusion system
- Add Animation Polish throughout
- Create Visual Effects library
- Establish visual consistency
- Optimize rendering performance

## User Stories

### Task 2: Implement scaling algorithms
**User Story:** As a player, I want characters to appear smaller when further away, so that the game world has realistic depth and perspective.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B2, U2, T1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Scaling based on Y position
  2. Configurable per district
  3. Smooth transitions
  4. Maintains sprite quality
  5. Consistent with perspective type

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reference: docs/design/sprite_perspective_scaling_full_plan.md
- Scale formula: scale = base_scale * (1 + (y - horizon) * perspective_factor)
- Consider different formulas for different perspectives
- Cache calculations for performance

### Task 7: Implement occlusion mapping
**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my character disappear behind foreground objects naturally, so that the world feels three-dimensional.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B2, U2, T2
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Characters occlude behind objects
  2. Smooth transition at edges
  3. Multiple occlusion layers
  4. Works with transparency
  5. No visual artifacts

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reference: docs/design/foreground_occlusion_full_plan.md
- Use Y-sorting for base ordering
- Occlusion maps define coverage areas
- Consider dithering for soft edges

### Task 13: Create transition animations
**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth transitions between character states, so that movement and actions feel fluid and natural.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B1, U3
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. All state changes have transitions
  2. No animation pops or jumps
  3. Context-appropriate timing
  4. Blends with movement
  5. Consistent across characters

**Implementation Notes:**
- Transition types: idle→walk, walk→run, any→interact
- Use animation blending for smoothness
- Consider animation priority system
- Test with different character types

### Task 18: Add screen effects
**User Story:** As a player, I want visual feedback through screen effects, so that important events and states are communicated clearly.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B3, U1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Detection warning vignette
  2. Damage/stress effects
  3. Environmental effects
  4. Transition effects
  5. Adjustable intensity

**Implementation Notes:**
