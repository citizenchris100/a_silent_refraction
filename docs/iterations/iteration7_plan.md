- [ ] Task 12: Create Engineering District unique quest line
- [ ] Task 13: Design main investigation multi-part quest line
- [ ] Task 14: Implement Part 1 of main investigation quest
- [ ] Task 15: Implement Part 2 of main investigation quest
- [ ] Task 16: Implement Part 3 of main investigation quest
- [ ] Task 17: Create assimilation detection mini-game mechanics
- [ ] Task 18: Implement resistance recruitment dialog system
- [ ] Task 19: Create consequences system for failed recruitment attempts
- [ ] Task 20: Design and implement quest rewards system
- [ ] Task 21: Create detection and suspicion system in quest interactions
- [ ] Task 22: Perform in-game integration testing of all Iteration 7 features

## Testing Criteria
- Quest system correctly tracks active, completed, and failed quests
- Quest log UI displays correct information and updates appropriately
- Intro and First Quest can be completed successfully
- District quests can be accepted, progressed, and completed
- Main investigation quest progresses as designed
- Quests appropriately update game state and trigger events
- Dialog-based quest interactions work correctly
- Assimilation detection provides appropriate clues
- Recruitment attempts succeed or fail based on dialog choices
- Suspicion system accurately reflects NPC state changes due to quest actions

## Timeline
- Start date: TBD
- Target completion: TBD (6-8 weeks estimated)

## Dependencies

## Notes
This iteration focuses on implementing the quest system which forms the core gameplay loop and narrative structure of the game. The quest system will tie together all previous systems (NPC interactions, dialog, suspicion, investigation) into coherent gameplay scenarios.

The quest system will implement the following quest types as described in the Game Design Document:
1. Standard quests that help identify assimilated/non-assimilated NPCs
2. Trap quests from assimilated NPCs that can lead to game over
3. District-specific major quests that can secure entire districts
4. The main investigation quest that reveals the backstory

All quests will integrate with the time management system, where actions advance game time and influence assimilation rates. The quest system will need to be flexible enough to handle branching paths and different outcomes based on player choices.
