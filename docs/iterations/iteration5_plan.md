# Iteration 5: Save System Foundation

## Goals
- Implement single-slot save system inspired by Dead Rising
- Create robust serialization architecture that can grow with the game
- Build atomic save operations to prevent corruption
- Develop save/load UI with clear progress indication
- Establish version migration framework for future updates
- Create modular serialization system to minimize future refactoring

## Requirements

### Business Requirements
- **B1:** Implement save system that reinforces permanent consequences
  - **Rationale:** Single-slot saves create tension and meaningful choices
  - **Success Metric:** Players report feeling weight of their decisions

- **B2:** Ensure save system reliability and corruption resistance
  - **Rationale:** Single slot means corruption is catastrophic
  - **Success Metric:** <0.001% corruption rate in production

### User Requirements
- **U1:** As a player, I want to save my progress when sleeping
  - **User Value:** Natural save points integrated with time management
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Saving advances time to next day

- **U2:** As a player, I want clear feedback during save/load operations
  - **User Value:** Understanding system state during critical operations
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Progress indicators and success confirmations

### Technical Requirements
- **T1:** Implement atomic file operations for save integrity
  - **Rationale:** Prevent partial writes during crashes/power loss
  - **Constraints:** Must use temp file + atomic rename pattern

- **T2:** Design extensible serialization architecture
  - **Rationale:** Future systems need easy integration
  - **Constraints:** Modular design with version support from day 1

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1: Implement core SaveManager with atomic file operations
- [ ] Task 2: Create modular serialization architecture
- [ ] Task 3: Implement player data serialization (position, stats, inventory)
- [ ] Task 4: Implement NPC state serialization (simple version)
- [ ] Task 5: Create world state serialization (districts, doors, etc.)
- [ ] Task 6: Implement save/load UI flow with progress indication
- [ ] Task 7: Create corruption detection and recovery system
- [ ] Task 8: Implement version migration framework
- [ ] Task 9: Add save file compression (Zstandard)
- [ ] Task 10: Create save system unit tests
- [ ] Task 11: Implement backup save management
- [ ] Task 12: Add save analytics for debugging

## Testing Criteria
- Save/load cycle preserves all game state correctly
- Save operations complete in <1 second for current game state
- Load operations complete in <2 seconds
- Corruption detection catches all test cases
- Version migration handles all upgrade paths
- UI provides clear feedback during operations
- Atomic operations prevent partial saves
- Backup system maintains previous save automatically

## Timeline
- Start date: 2025-05-15
- Target completion: 2025-05-22

## Dependencies
- Iteration 1 (Basic Environment and Navigation)
- Iteration 2 (NPC Framework and Suspicion System)
- Iteration 3 (Navigation Refactoring and Multi-Perspective Character System)
- Iteration 4 (Dialog and Verb UI System Refactoring)

## User Stories

### Task 1: Implement core SaveManager with atomic file operations
**User Story:** As a developer, I want atomic save operations, so that saves never corrupt even during power loss.
**Reference:** See docs/design/serialization_system.md Section "Atomic Save Process"

### Task 2: Create modular serialization architecture
**User Story:** As a developer, I want modular serializers, so that new systems can be added without refactoring.
**Reference:** See docs/design/serialization_system.md Section "Serialization Strategy"

### Task 3: Implement player data serialization
**User Story:** As a player, I want my character's state preserved, so that I continue exactly where I left off.
**Reference:** See docs/design/serialization_system.md Section "Player Data Serialization"

### Task 4: Implement NPC state serialization (simple version)
**User Story:** As a player, I want NPC positions and states preserved, so that the world remains consistent.
**Reference:** See docs/design/serialization_system.md Section "NPC State Compression"

### Task 5: Create world state serialization
**User Story:** As a player, I want environmental changes preserved, so that my actions have lasting impact.
**Reference:** See docs/design/serialization_system.md Section "Hierarchical Data Organization"

### Task 6: Implement save/load UI flow with progress indication
**User Story:** As a player, I want to see save/load progress, so that I know the operation is working.
**Reference:** See docs/design/serialization_system.md Section "Progressive Loading"

### Task 7: Create corruption detection and recovery system
**User Story:** As a player, I want automatic recovery from corruption, so that I don't lose all progress.
**Reference:** See docs/design/serialization_system.md Section "Corruption Detection"

### Task 8: Implement version migration framework
**User Story:** As a player, I want my saves to work after updates, so that I can continue my playthrough.
**Reference:** See docs/design/serialization_system.md Section "Version Migration"

### Task 9: Add save file compression
**User Story:** As a developer, I want compressed saves, so that file sizes remain manageable.
**Reference:** See docs/design/serialization_system.md Section "File Format"

### Task 10: Create save system unit tests
**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive save testing, so that we catch issues before release.
**Reference:** See docs/design/serialization_system.md Section "Testing Framework"

### Task 11: Implement backup save management
**User Story:** As a player, I want automatic backups, so that corruption doesn't mean total loss.
**Reference:** See docs/design/serialization_system.md Section "Save File Structure"

### Task 12: Add save analytics for debugging
**User Story:** As a developer, I want save file analytics, so that I can optimize performance.
**Reference:** See docs/design/serialization_system.md Section "Save File Analytics"

## Notes
- This iteration creates the foundation for all future save functionality
- Focus on extensibility - future systems will add significant complexity
- Single-slot design means reliability is paramount
- Dead Rising inspiration: saves should feel weighty and consequential
- Modular architecture will minimize refactoring as new systems are added
