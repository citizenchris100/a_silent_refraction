## User Stories

### Task 1: Create AudioEventBridge singleton
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a centralized audio event system, so that any game system can trigger audio without tight coupling.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B1, T1
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Systems register audio events by name
  2. Events trigger appropriate sounds
  3. No direct references between systems
  4. Supports parameter passing
  5. Handles missing audio gracefully

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reference: docs/design/audio_system_technical_implementation.md
- Event examples: "footstep", "door_open", "suspicion_increase"
- Use signals for decoupling
- Consider audio event queuing

### Task 6: Implement DiegeticAudioController
**User Story:** As a player, I want sounds to come from their sources in the game world, so that I can use audio to understand my environment.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (05/26/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B2, U2, T2
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Audio sources have 3D positions
  2. Volume/pan based on position
  3. Occlusion affects muffling
  4. Doppler effect for moving sources
  5. Max distance cutoff

**Implementation Notes:**
- Reference: docs/design/audio_system_iteration3_mvp.md
