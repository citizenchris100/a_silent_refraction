# Iteration 13: Complete Diegetic Audio System

## Epic Description
**Phase**: 2 - Full Systems  
**Cohesive Goal**: "I am immersed in a world where every sound has a source"

As a player, I want to experience a fully diegetic audio environment where all sounds originate from visible sources in the game world, with proper spatial positioning, distance attenuation, and integration with the perspective system, creating an immersive soundscape that reinforces the corporate banality and creeping dread of the space station.

## Goals
- Complete spatial audio implementation with stereo panning
- Implement full district audio system with transitions
- Create PA announcement system and audio zones
- Add audio-gameplay integration features
- Optimize performance with audio LOD system
- Establish audio content production pipeline

## User Stories

### Task 1: Implement custom stereo panning system
**User Story:** As a player, I want to hear sounds coming from the left or right based on their position relative to my character, so that I can locate audio sources spatially even without visual cues.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (06/01/25)

**Requirements:**

**Implementation Notes:**
- Extend DiegeticAudioController from Iteration 3
- Use AudioEffectPanner on audio buses
- Reference: docs/design/audio_system_technical_implementation.md - Section 3
- Calculate pan based on screen position, not world position
- Pan range configurable per audio source

### Task 6: Create DistrictAudioConfig resource class
**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure district-specific audio through resource files, so that I can quickly define unique soundscapes for each area without writing code.

**Status History:**
- **⏳ PENDING** (06/01/25)

**Requirements:**
- **Linked to:** B2, T2
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Resource defines music and ambience sources
  2. Supports multiple audio source positions
  3. Includes environmental effect settings
  4. Configures fade in/out times
  5. Hot-reloadable for rapid iteration

**Implementation Notes:**

- Include properties for:
  - music_sources: Array[AudioSourceDefinition]
  - ambience_sources: Array[AudioSourceDefinition]
  - reverb settings
  - audio zones
- Create .tres files for each district

### Task 11: Implement PA announcement system
