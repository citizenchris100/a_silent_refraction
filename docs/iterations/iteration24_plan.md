# Iteration 24: Hardware Validation and Distribution

## Phase
**Phase 3: Post-Release** - After the game is complete and tested, this iteration focuses on creating the unique hardware-based distribution model.

## Goals
- Validate game performance on Raspberry Pi 5 hardware
- Develop custom Linux distribution for direct-boot experience
- Create manufacturing and distribution pipeline
- Test complete hardware package with real users

## Requirements

### Business Requirements
- **B1:** Create unique physical distribution model
  - **Rationale:** Hardware distribution provides piracy protection and premium positioning
  - **Success Metric:** <2% hardware failure rate, >90% customer satisfaction

- **B2:** Achieve optimal performance on target hardware
  - **Rationale:** Smooth gameplay essential for premium product experience
  - **Success Metric:** Stable 30fps minimum, 60fps preferred on Raspberry Pi 5

### User Requirements
- **U1:** As a player, I want a plug-and-play gaming experience
  - **User Value:** Zero installation or configuration required
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Boot to game menu in <30 seconds, no technical knowledge needed

- **U2:** As a player, I want a collectible physical product
  - **User Value:** Premium packaging and unique distribution adds value
  - **Acceptance Criteria:** Professional packaging with custom case and documentation

### Technical Requirements
- **T1:** Optimize for ARM architecture
  - **Rationale:** Raspberry Pi 5 uses ARM CPU requiring specific optimizations
  - **Constraints:** Must maintain visual quality while achieving performance targets

- **T2:** Implement hardware validation
  - **Rationale:** Prevent unauthorized copying while allowing legitimate use
  - **Constraints:** Must not interfere with gameplay or require internet connection

## Tasks

### Hardware Validation
- [ ] Task 1: Acquire Raspberry Pi 5 development hardware
  - **User Story:** As a developer, I want the target hardware platform available for testing, so that I can validate performance and compatibility early in the process.
- [ ] Task 2: Set up cross-compilation toolchain for ARM
  - **User Story:** As a developer, I want an efficient build process for ARM architecture, so that I can rapidly iterate on performance optimizations.
- [ ] Task 3: Build and test Godot game on Pi 5
  - **User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the complete game runs on target hardware, so that I can identify any compatibility issues before production.
- [ ] Task 4: Performance profiling and optimization
  - **User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify performance bottlenecks on ARM hardware, so that I can optimize for smooth gameplay on the target platform.
- [ ] Task 5: Memory usage optimization
  - **User Story:** As a developer, I want to minimize memory usage, so that the game runs reliably within the Pi 5's 8GB RAM constraint.
- [ ] Task 6: Test with various display resolutions
  - **User Story:** As a player, I want the game to display correctly on my TV or monitor, so that I can enjoy the full visual experience regardless of my display.

### Custom Linux Distribution  
- [ ] Task 7: Set up Buildroot development environment
- [ ] Task 8: Create minimal Linux configuration
- [ ] Task 9: Implement custom boot splash screen
- [ ] Task 10: Configure auto-launch into game
- [ ] Task 11: Create read-only filesystem setup
- [ ] Task 12: Implement hardware fingerprinting

### Manufacturing Pipeline
- [ ] Task 13: Source components and suppliers
- [ ] Task 14: Design custom case with branding
- [ ] Task 15: Create SD card flashing process
- [ ] Task 16: Develop QA testing procedures
- [ ] Task 17: Design packaging and documentation
- [ ] Task 18: Set up fulfillment process

### User Testing
- [ ] Task 19: Create beta hardware units
- [ ] Task 20: Conduct user testing sessions
- [ ] Task 21: Gather performance metrics
- [ ] Task 22: Iterate based on feedback
- [ ] Task 23: Finalize production specifications

## Testing Criteria
- Game runs at stable 30+ FPS on Raspberry Pi 5
- Boot time from power-on to main menu <30 seconds
- All game features function correctly on ARM architecture
- Custom Linux distribution boots reliably
- Hardware validation doesn't impact gameplay
- SD card image can be replicated consistently
- Complete hardware package passes 2-hour stress test
- Packaging protects hardware during shipping

## Timeline
- Start date: After game release (Iteration 23)
- Target completion: 6-8 weeks
- Note: Can begin planning during Iteration 22-23

## Dependencies
- Complete game (Iteration 1-23)
- Final performance optimization (Iteration 22)
- Hardware supplier relationships
- Beta testing group recruited

## Code Links
- No links yet

## Notes
- This iteration happens POST-RELEASE of the digital game
- Hardware distribution is a premium option, not primary release
- Initial production run should be limited (100-500 units)
- Consider Kickstarter for initial hardware funding

### Design Documents Implemented
- docs/design/hardware_validation_plan.md

### Template References
- Hardware validation procedures should be thoroughly documented for manufacturing partners
