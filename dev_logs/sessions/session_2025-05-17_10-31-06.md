# Development Session: Scrolling Camera Implementation
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Time:** 10:31:06
**Iteration:** 2 - NPC Framework, Suspicion System, and Initial Asset Creation
**Task Focus:** Shipping District Camera Integration

## Session Goals
- Complete Iteration 2 Task 6: Implement scrolling camera system that enables environments larger than the game window
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement observation mechanics for detecting assimilated NPCs

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Implement proper walkable area for the scrolling camera test that extends across the full background width
- [ ] Test the scrolling camera functionality with the updated walkable area in test scene
- [ ] Apply the walkable area improvements to the Spaceport/Shipping district scene
- [ ] 

## Notes
- The clean_camera_test.tscn scene (run with './a_silent_refraction.sh camera') is our reference implementation for scrolling camera. It's located at src/test/clean_camera_test.tscn with its script at src/test/clean_camera_test.gd. This scene creates a walkable area that spans the full width of the background and configures proper scrolling camera functionality.
- According to docs/scrolling_camera_system.md, implementation tasks include: (1) Update shipping_district.gd to enable scrolling camera and configure parameters, (2) Adjust shipping_district.tscn to update background sprite and walkable areas, (3) Create a wider background for the shipping district, and (4) Thoroughly test camera behavior.
- Key components from clean_camera_test.gd implementation: (1) Using a Sprite instead of TextureRect, (2) Setting use_scrolling_camera=true, (3) Creating an appropriate walkable area with proper coordinates for the full width of the background, (4) Properly handling camera view switching (left, center, right), and (5) Ensuring the background is wide enough to necessitate scrolling.
- Based on examining the clean_camera_test.gd script and comparing with shipping_district.gd, we need to make these changes: 1) Convert the TextureRect to a Sprite with centered=false for proper camera bounds calculation, 2) Enable scrolling camera with use_scrolling_camera=true, 3) Define a walkable area that spans the full width of the background, and 4) Test the camera view positions (left, center, right) to ensure proper scrolling behavior.
- 

## Next Steps
- Test the camera view positions (left, center, right) to ensure proper scrolling behavior
- Define a walkable area that spans the full width of the background
- Enable scrolling camera with use_scrolling_camera=true in shipping_district.gd
- Convert the TextureRect to a Sprite with centered=false for proper camera bounds calculation
