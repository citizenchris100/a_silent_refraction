# Development Session: Scrolling Camera Implementation
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Time:** 10:31:06
**Iteration:** 2 - NPC Framework, Suspicion System, and Initial Asset Creation
**Task Focus:** Shipping District Camera Integration

## Session Goals
- Complete Iteration 2 Task 6: Implement scrolling camera system that enables environments larger than the game window
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement observation mechanics for detecting assimilated NPCs

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Implement proper walkable area for the scrolling camera test that extends across the full background width
- [ ] Test the scrolling camera functionality with the updated walkable area in test scene
- [ ] Apply the walkable area improvements to the Spaceport/Shipping district scene
- [ ] 

## Notes
- Code Analysis: After comparing the clean_camera_test.gd files between our current branch and the working commit (3ceb3e7), we found that the code is identical in both versions. The walkable area is created programmatically in the create_walkable_area() function, with designer_selected_points defining the walkable area's polygon. The issue appears to be something else in the code execution rather than differences in the source files. The walkable area is being added to both the 'designer_walkable_area' and 'walkable_area' groups, which should make it a priority area for the camera bounds calculation. Since the code itself is identical, the issue could be related to how the area is being processed by the BaseDistrict class or the ScrollingCamera class, or how the debug visualization is working.
- Screenshot Analysis: After examining the provided screenshots, it's clear there's a significant difference in the walkable area implementation between the current branch and commit 3ceb3e7f561d1f8f4d5f81a41fe84c0ee7607bff.

1. In debug008.png and debug009.png (current branch): The walkable area appears as a small, narrow green rectangle located only on the left side of the scene, covering just a small portion of what should be the walkable floor area. This is definitely incorrect as it doesn't span the width of the background and would severely limit player movement.

2. In working_walkable_area.png (from commit 3ceb3e7): The walkable area properly covers the entire floor area of the shipping dock, shown as a wide green semi-transparent polygon that extends across the full width of the background image. This is the correct implementation that allows players to navigate properly throughout the scene.

The issue appears to be that somewhere between the working commit and the current branch, the walkable area coordinates were either reset or incorrectly modified. We'll need to examine the code in both states to determine what's causing this discrepancy and how to fix it in our current branch.
- Testing observation: When running the 'camera' test from our current working branch, the walkable area appears to be a small rectangle in the center-left of the screen, not covering the expected floor area as designated with the debug coordinates tool. After switching to commit 3ceb3e7f561d1f8f4d5f81a41fe84c0ee7607bff, the walkable area works correctly, appearing as a green polygon that properly covers the floor area of the background image. Screenshots of both states were captured in src/assets/debug/debug008.png (zoomed out view showing incorrect walkable area), src/assets/debug/debug009.png (close-up of incorrect walkable area), and src/assets/debug/working_walkable_area.png (correct walkable area from the specific commit).
- The clean_camera_test.tscn scene (run with './a_silent_refraction.sh camera') is our reference implementation for scrolling camera. It's located at src/test/clean_camera_test.tscn with its script at src/test/clean_camera_test.gd. This scene creates a walkable area that spans the full width of the background and configures proper scrolling camera functionality.
- According to docs/scrolling_camera_system.md, implementation tasks include: (1) Update shipping_district.gd to enable scrolling camera and configure parameters, (2) Adjust shipping_district.tscn to update background sprite and walkable areas, (3) Create a wider background for the shipping district, and (4) Thoroughly test camera behavior.
- Key components from clean_camera_test.gd implementation: (1) Using a Sprite instead of TextureRect, (2) Setting use_scrolling_camera=true, (3) Creating an appropriate walkable area with proper coordinates for the full width of the background, (4) Properly handling camera view switching (left, center, right), and (5) Ensuring the background is wide enough to necessitate scrolling.
- Based on examining the clean_camera_test.gd script and comparing with shipping_district.gd, we need to make these changes: 1) Convert the TextureRect to a Sprite with centered=false for proper camera bounds calculation, 2) Enable scrolling camera with use_scrolling_camera=true, 3) Define a walkable area that spans the full width of the background, and 4) Test the camera view positions (left, center, right) to ensure proper scrolling behavior.
- 

## Next Steps
- Test the camera view positions (left, center, right) to ensure proper scrolling behavior
- Define a walkable area that spans the full width of the background
- Enable scrolling camera with use_scrolling_camera=true in shipping_district.gd
- Convert the TextureRect to a Sprite with centered=false for proper camera bounds calculation
