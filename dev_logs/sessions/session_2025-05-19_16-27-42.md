# Development Session: Unit Test Investigation
**Date:** May 19, 2025
**Time:** 16:27:42
**Iteration:** 4 - Investigation Mechanics and Inventory
**Task Focus:** Fix remaining failing tests with the refactored camera system

## Session Goals
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create quest data structure and manager
- [ ] Implement quest log UI
- [ ] Develop advanced inventory features including categorization
- [ ] Create puzzles for accessing restricted areas
- [ ] Implement clue discovery and collection system
- [ ] Create assimilated NPC tracking log
- [ ] Develop investigation progress tracking
- [ ] Add quest state persistence
- [ ] Implement overflow inventory storage in player's room
- [ ] Create UI for transferring items between personal inventory and room storage
- [ ] Implement observation mechanics for detecting assimilated NPCs (As a player, I want to carefully observe NPCs for subtle clues that indicate they have been assimilated, so that I can identify threats and make informed decisions about whom to trust and recruit.)

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Fix coordinate_system_test issues
- [ ] Fix camera_walkable_integration_test issues
- [ ] Fix coordinate_conversion_test issues
- [ ] Fix scrolling_camera_test issues
- [ ] 

## Notes
- ## Unit Test Status

After implementing the camera bounds validation refactoring, the unit test status is as follows:

1. ✅ **bounds_calculator_test** - PASSING (20/20 tests)
2. ✅ **camera_state_test** - PASSING (30/30 tests)
3. ❌ **camera_walkable_integration_test** - FAILING/TIMING OUT
4. ❌ **coordinate_conversion_test** - TIMING OUT
5. ❌ **coordinate_manager_test** - TIMING OUT
6. ❌ **coordinate_system_test** - TIMING OUT
7. ❌ **coordinate_transformation_test** - TIMING OUT
8. ❌ **scrolling_camera_test** - TIMING OUT
9. ❌ **view_mode_transition_test** - TIMING OUT

The camera_state_test was specifically targeted by our refactoring and is now passing. The other failing tests appear to have pre-existing issues unrelated to our changes.
