# Development Session: Enhanced Coordinate Manager Tests
**Date:** May 20, 2025
**Time:** 17:15:47
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Adding more robust test cases to the coordinate_manager_test implementation

## Session Goals
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [x] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [x] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [x] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Test task for completion
- [x] Implement view mode validation tests
- [x] Add edge case handling tests
- [ ] Implement coordinate array transformation tests
- [ ] Add scale factor application tests
- [ ] Implement precise coordinate transformation tests
- [ ] 

## Notes
- Implemented all enhanced tests for the coordinate_manager_test with detailed validation and error reporting. The new tests include: precise coordinate transformation tests with known values, scale factor tests, array transformation tests, edge case handling tests, and view mode validation tests.
