**Date:** May 31, 2025
**Time:** 06:38:43
**Iteration:** 2 - NPC Framework and Suspicion System
**Task Focus:** Implement TDD tests for navigation system signal communication

## Session Goals

- [ ] Document signal usage patterns and create examples
- [x] Implement signal connections in GameManager after tests pass
- [ ] Create signal_cleanup_subsystem_test.gd - Subsystem test for signal cleanup on scene changes
- [ ] Create navigation_signal_flow_subsystem_test.gd - Subsystem test for complete navigation signal flow
- [x] Create input_game_manager_signal_component_test.gd - Component test for Input-GameManager signal chain
- [x] Create game_manager_camera_signal_component_test.gd - Component test for GameManager-Camera signals
- [x] Create game_manager_player_signal_component_test.gd - Component test for GameManager-Player signals
- [x] Create input_manager_signal_test.gd - Unit test for input manager signals
- [x] Create player_signal_emission_test.gd - Unit test for player movement_state_changed signal
- [x] Create game_manager_signal_test.gd - Unit test for GameManager signal management
- [x] 

## Notes
- SIGNAL CLEANUP SUBSYSTEM TEST - This test ensures proper signal cleanup during scene transitions and component lifecycle. Components: GameManager, Player, Camera, InputManager, District, NPCs. Test scenarios: 1) Scene change cleanup - load district, connect all signals, change district, verify old connections cleaned and new ones established, 2) Component removal during runtime - remove player or camera while connected, add remove NPCs, verify no crashes, 3) Game state transitions - pause unpause, menu open close, save load, verify signal consistency. Success criteria: No memory leaks from orphaned connections, no errors on component removal, signals reconnect properly after cleanup.
- NAVIGATION SIGNAL FLOW SUBSYSTEM TEST - This test validates the complete signal chain during navigation. Components: InputManager detects click, GameManager coordinates, Player moves and emits state changes, ScrollingCamera follows and emits position signals, District provides boundaries. Test scenarios: 1) Complete click to movement flow verifying all signals emit in correct order, 2) Multi component state synchronization with rapid clicks, 3) Edge cases like clicking outside walkable areas or during movement. Success criteria: All 5+ components communicate correctly through signals with no missed events or race conditions.
- TDD State for Task 10: All Unit and Component tests have been created and fixed. Unit tests: GameManager test correctly fails for missing Player/Camera signal connections (4 failures), Player/Camera/InputManager tests pass for existing signals. Component tests: All 3 tests created, Input-GameManager passes (existing connection works), GameManager-Camera and GameManager-Player fail correctly for missing connections. Tests are now proper TDD tests failing for the right reasons. Next step: Create Subsystem tests for complete navigation signal flow and signal cleanup.
- Component test fixes applied. Camera test now passes. Player and Input-GameManager tests still have object lifecycle issues due to yields in _ready() methods. These are test infrastructure issues, not TDD failures for missing functionality.
- Component Test Analysis: 1) GameManager-Player: Some tests pass, but has object lifecycle issues. 2) GameManager-Camera: Failed due to wrong method names in test (setup_camera_bounds->camera_bounds.size, set_follow_target->set_target_player, _set_camera_state doesn't exist). 3) Input-GameManager: Connection exists but test verification failed. Need to fix test issues before proceeding.
- Component tests created and running. GameManager-Player test mostly passes. Camera test needs fixes for missing methods. Input-GameManager test has existing connection working.
- Unit tests created. Player and InputManager already have required signals. GameManager needs implementation of signal connection methods
- Key findings: GameManager lacks signal connections to player movement_state_changed and camera signals. No signal cleanup in most components except ScrollingCamera
- Following TDD approach: Tests first, then implementation. Focus on enhancing existing signal communication between navigation systems (GameManager, Player, Camera, InputManager)
- 

## Next Steps
- Start with unit tests following TDD approach - write failing tests first
