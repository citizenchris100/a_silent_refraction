# Development Session: District and NPC Creation Gap Analysis
**Date:** May 25, 2025
**Time:** 07:58:25
**Iteration:** 2 - NPC Framework and Suspicion System
**Task Focus:** Identifying missing tasks for location and character implementation

## Session Goals
- Analyze current iteration plans to identify missing district and NPC creation tasks
- 

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] 

## Notes
- Created all 5 template design documents: Template NPC, Template District, Template Dialog, Template Interactive Object, and Template Quest. Removed old quest_design.md that didn't align with template approach.
- Created formal phased development approach document at docs/reference/phased_development_approach.md that defines three phases: MVP Systems, Full Systems, and Full Content Implementation
- Building narrative content on incomplete systems may require significant rework when systems are finalized
- Consider moving narrative content tasks like quests and investigation mechanics to after full systems implementation
- Early iterations focus on MVP implementations while later iterations expand to full system versions
- No tasks for creating NPC sprites for characters like Dock Workers Security Officers Doctors Bank Tellers Patrons etc
- Missing districts include Mall Medical Security Trading Floor Barracks and Engineering
- GDD lists approximately 150 NPCs across 7 districts but current tasks only create Shipping District and one additional district
- Major gap identified in iteration planning - no specific tasks for creating the 7 districts defined in GDD
- 

## Next Steps
- Propose restructuring iterations to complete all technical systems before narrative content development
- Create comprehensive list of all districts and NPCs that need implementation based on GDD
- Determine whether to create dedicated iteration for District and NPC Implementation or distribute tasks across existing iterations
-
