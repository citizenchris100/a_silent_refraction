## Notes
- IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT 10 - Fix camera group registration: ScrollingCamera needs to add itself to 'camera' group in _ready() so it can be found by other systems. Currently camera is not in the expected group causing test failures.
- IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT 9 - Add connection integrity verification: GameManager needs verify_connections() or _check_connection_integrity() method to validate all tracked connections still point to valid objects. Remove any orphaned connections. Call periodically or before major operations.
- IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT 8 - Add NPC lifecycle management: GameManager needs methods: _on_npc_added(npc) to connect NPC signals when added to scene, _on_npc_removed(npc) to disconnect before removal, _connect_npc_signals(npc), _disconnect_npc_signals(npc). Monitor tree for npc group changes.
- IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT 7 - Add duplicate connection protection: Before connecting any signal, GameManager should check if connection already exists using is_connected(). Wrap all connect() calls with this check. Add connect_to_player(player_node) method that safely connects without duplicates.
- IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT 6 - Add cleanup methods to GameManager: GameManager needs cleanup methods: cleanup_connections() to disconnect all tracked connections, _cleanup_signals() for internal use, disconnect_player_signals(), disconnect_camera_signals(). Call cleanup_connections() when scene changes or in _exit_tree().
- IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT 5 - Add connection tracking to GameManager: GameManager needs an 'active_connections' dictionary to track all signal connections. Add methods: _track_connection(signal_owner, signal_name, target, method), get_active_connections(), get_connection_count(). This enables monitoring and cleanup.
- IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT 4 - Add signal handler methods to GameManager: GameManager needs these handler methods: _on_player_movement_state_changed(new_state), _on_camera_move_started(target_position, old_position, move_duration, transition_type), _on_camera_move_completed(final_position, initial_position, actual_duration), _on_camera_state_changed(new_state, old_state, transition_reason)
- IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT 3 - Add signal connection methods to GameManager: GameManager needs methods to find and connect to Player and ScrollingCamera signals: _find_and_connect_player(), _find_and_connect_camera(). These should be called from _ready() and look for nodes in 'player' and 'camera' groups respectively.
- IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT 2 - Make InputManager discoverable: InputManager needs to be added to the 'input_manager' group in its _ready() method so subsystem tests can find it. Currently tests cannot locate InputManager instance.
- IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT 1 - Make GameManager discoverable: GameManager needs to be added to the 'game_manager' group in its _ready() method so subsystem tests can find it. Currently tests cannot locate GameManager instance.
- SUCCESS: All subsystem tests for Task 10 have been created and are failing as expected for TDD. Created signal_cleanup_subsystem_test.gd and navigation_signal_flow_subsystem_test.gd. These tests validate signal flow coordination between 5+ components and proper cleanup on scene changes. Both tests run successfully and fail with clear indicators of what functionality needs to be implemented.
- Omni test run shows 4 unit tests failing (camera_signal_test, game_manager_signal_test, input_manager_signal_test, player_signal_emission_test). These are the expected TDD failures for Task 10. All subsystem tests have been created and also fail as expected. Ready for implementation phase.
- SIGNAL CLEANUP SUBSYSTEM TEST - This test ensures proper signal cleanup during scene transitions and component lifecycle. Components: GameManager, Player, Camera, InputManager, District, NPCs. Test scenarios: 1) Scene change cleanup - load district, connect all signals, change district, verify old connections cleaned and new ones established, 2) Component removal during runtime - remove player or camera while connected, add remove NPCs, verify no crashes, 3) Game state transitions - pause unpause, menu open close, save load, verify signal consistency. Success criteria: No memory leaks from orphaned connections, no errors on component removal, signals reconnect properly after cleanup.
- NAVIGATION SIGNAL FLOW SUBSYSTEM TEST - This test validates the complete signal chain during navigation. Components: InputManager detects click, GameManager coordinates, Player moves and emits state changes, ScrollingCamera follows and emits position signals, District provides boundaries. Test scenarios: 1) Complete click to movement flow verifying all signals emit in correct order, 2) Multi component state synchronization with rapid clicks, 3) Edge cases like clicking outside walkable areas or during movement. Success criteria: All 5+ components communicate correctly through signals with no missed events or race conditions.
- TDD State for Task 10: All Unit and Component tests have been created and fixed. Unit tests: GameManager test correctly fails for missing Player/Camera signal connections (4 failures), Player/Camera/InputManager tests pass for existing signals. Component tests: All 3 tests created, Input-GameManager passes (existing connection works), GameManager-Camera and GameManager-Player fail correctly for missing connections. Tests are now proper TDD tests failing for the right reasons. Next step: Create Subsystem tests for complete navigation signal flow and signal cleanup.
- Component test fixes applied. Camera test now passes. Player and Input-GameManager tests still have object lifecycle issues due to yields in _ready() methods. These are test infrastructure issues, not TDD failures for missing functionality.
- Component Test Analysis: 1) GameManager-Player: Some tests pass, but has object lifecycle issues. 2) GameManager-Camera: Failed due to wrong method names in test (setup_camera_bounds->camera_bounds.size, set_follow_target->set_target_player, _set_camera_state doesn't exist). 3) Input-GameManager: Connection exists but test verification failed. Need to fix test issues before proceeding.
- Component tests created and running. GameManager-Player test mostly passes. Camera test needs fixes for missing methods. Input-GameManager test has existing connection working.
- Unit tests created. Player and InputManager already have required signals. GameManager needs implementation of signal connection methods
- Key findings: GameManager lacks signal connections to player movement_state_changed and camera signals. No signal cleanup in most components except ScrollingCamera
- Following TDD approach: Tests first, then implementation. Focus on enhancing existing signal communication between navigation systems (GameManager, Player, Camera, InputManager)
- 

## Next Steps
- Start with unit tests following TDD approach - write failing tests first
