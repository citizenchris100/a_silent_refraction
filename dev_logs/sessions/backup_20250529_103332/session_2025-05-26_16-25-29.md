## Notes
- MAJOR SESSION ACCOMPLISHMENT: Completed ALL iteration planning work! Successfully: 1) Updated iteration_planner.sh to support iterations 8-23 with full requirements, 2) Rewrote ALL Phase 1 iterations (4-8) with new system mapping, 3) Wrote ALL Phase 2 iterations (9-15) including new Iteration 16 for Visual Systems, 4) Created ALL Phase 3 content iterations (17-23) aligned with phase3_content_implementation_roadmap.md. Every iteration now has: epic descriptions, cohesive goals, business/user/technical requirements, detailed tasks with user stories, dependencies, and proper formatting. The entire game development roadmap is now fully documented across 23 iterations!
- Phase 2 iterations progressing excellently! Completed: I9 (Core Gameplay - observation/investigation/detection), I10 (Advanced NPCs - relationships/routines/disguises), I11 (Quest Systems - framework/jobs/First Quest), I12 (Assimilation/Coalition - dynamic threats/resistance/endings). Each iteration has epic descriptions, cohesive goals, comprehensive tasks with user stories, and proper dependencies. 4 of 8 Phase 2 iterations complete!
- Completed updating Phase 1 iteration files (4-8). All now match the new mapping: I4=Serialization Foundation, I5=Time and Notification Systems, I6=Dialog and Character Systems, I7=Economy and Save/Sleep, I8=Districts and Living World MVP. Each file includes epic descriptions, cohesive goals, proper requirements, detailed tasks with user stories, and validates with iteration_planner.sh format. Phase 1 culminates with the Intro Quest in I8.
- Updated iteration files 4 and 5 to match new mapping. Iteration 4 is now 'Serialization Foundation' with modular architecture, self-registration, and compression. Iteration 5 is now 'Time and Notification Systems' with TimeManager and PromptNotificationSystem. Both files now include epic descriptions, cohesive goals, proper requirements, detailed tasks with user stories, and match the iteration_planner.sh format.
- Updated iteration_planner.sh to support iterations 8-23. Added: Business requirements for all iterations through 23, User requirements for all iterations, covering Phase 1 MVP (I8), Phase 2 Full Systems (I9-16), and Phase 3 Content (I17-23). Script now handles all iterations defined in iteration_to_phase_mapping.md.
- Updated iteration_to_phase_mapping.md to include ALL designed systems. Added: Inventory UI, SCUMM Hover Text, Detection Game Over, District Access Control, Investigation Tracking, Multi-Perspective Character System, Trading Floor Minigame. Created new Iteration 16 for Advanced Visual Systems. All 54 design documents are now mapped to specific iterations.
- CORRECTION: There are 54 design documents total. The vast majority (40+) are NOT explicitly mapped to iterations in the current plan. Major unmapped systems include: Inventory UI, Disguise System, Crime/Security Events, Investigation Tracking, Job/Work Quests, NPC Trust/Relationships, Puzzle System, SCUMM Hover Text, Trading Floor Minigame, Transportation/Tram, District Access Control, Morning Report Manager, and many more. The iteration plan needs MAJOR expansion to cover all designed systems.
- Found 5 design systems not explicitly mapped to iterations: 1) SCUMM Hover Text System, 2) Detection Game Over System, 3) District Access Control System, 4) Trading Floor Minigame, 5) Multi-Perspective Character System. These need to be added to appropriate iterations.
- CRITICAL DEPENDENCY FINDINGS: 1) Modular Serialization must come FIRST (everything saves), 2) Time Management is foundational (NPCs, events, save all need it), 3) Save/Sleep are circular - implement together, 4) Dialog refactoring must happen before NPCs (gender-aware), 5) Districts need camera/coordinate systems first. Key insight: Current iteration order is WRONG - we need serialization and time BEFORE save system!
- Iteration planning analysis complete. Major findings: 1) Iterations 4-7 have been reorganized from original plan (Dialog/Verb moved to I4, Save to I5, etc), 2) Most iterations lack epic descriptions and user stories, 3) Need to reorganize iterations 8+ to properly map to Phase 2/3, 4) Iteration planner script templates don't match actual files, 5) Phase 3 content iterations need to be created (likely I15+)
- Updated and moved system_integration_matrix.md to docs/reference/. Matrix now accurately reflects all designed systems and integrations. Key findings: Audio is NOT isolated (has full event-driven design), all 'missing' integrations are actually designed, 14+ additional systems exist beyond original matrix. Reality: comprehensive design coverage exists for both Phase 1 and Phase 2.
- System Integration Matrix appears outdated! It claims audio has no event integration, but the audio design docs exist. Matrix also doesn't account for many newly designed systems like observation_system_full_design.md, trading floor minigame, investigation tracking, etc. Matrix needs update to reflect actual design state.
- Created performance_optimization_plan.md - final missing piece for Phase 2! Plan includes: asset optimization (textures, sprites, audio), scene structure, script optimization (event-driven vs polling), rendering optimization, save compression, district loading strategy, NPC LOD system, and profiling tools. Phase 2 design documentation is now COMPLETE!
- Phase 2 ACTUAL GAPS FOUND: 1) NPC Daily Schedules/Routines (NPCs need time-based behaviors), 2) Weather/Atmospheric Systems (environmental effects), 3) Crowd Behavior (multiple NPC interactions), 4) Performance Optimization Plan, 5) Tutorial/Onboarding System, 6) Accessibility Features. Also potentially missing: shader effects documentation, cutscene/cinematic system, achievement system, and config/settings management.
- Phase 2 Full Systems Requirements Analysis: Many 'full' versions already designed! Found: suspicion_system_full_design.md, time_management_system_full.md, living_world_event_system_full.md, observation_system_full_design.md, sprite_perspective_scaling_full_plan.md, foreground_occlusion_full_plan.md. Also refactoring plans for dialog, navigation, and verb UI. Need to identify what MVP->Full expansions are still needed.
- CORRECTION: Reviewing design docs created May 24-26 shows comprehensive coverage! Found: audio_system_iteration3_mvp.md, save_system_design.md, character_gender_selection_system.md, verb_ui_system_refactoring_plan.md, inventory_system_design.md, detection_game_over_system_design.md + suspicion_system_full_design.md, time_management_system_mvp.md, and district templates. User has indeed filled Phase 1 design gaps!
- Phase 1 MVP Gaps identified: 1) Audio system completely isolated with no event integration, 2) Save system lacking audio feedback and uses custom UI instead of PromptNotificationSystem, 3) No player character gender selection system (required by design pillar #15), 4) Missing verb UI system implementation, 5) No inventory system (required for Intro Quest), 6) Detection/suspicion mechanics not yet implemented, 7) Time management system not started, 8) No district transition system
- Reviewed core documentation: phased_development_approach.md shows 3 phases (MVP, Full Systems, Content), system_integration_matrix.md reveals audio isolation and UI redundancy issues, game_design_document.md emphasizes 15 design pillars including time pressure and permanent choices
