# Development Session: Iteration 3 Task 3: Camera Test Scene Validation and Background Creation
**Date:** May 23, 2025
**Time:** 08:50:31
**Iteration:** 3 - Navigation Refactoring and Multi-Perspective Character System
**Task Focus:** Complete camera test scene implementation and begin navigation refactoring

## Session Goals
- Create the remaining 5 test background images for comprehensive camera testing
- Validate the camera test scene implementation works correctly without visual artifacts
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create test scene for validating camera system improvements
- [ ] Enhance player controller for consistent physics behavior (As a player, I want my character to move naturally with smooth acceleration and deceleration, so that navigation feels responsive and realistic.)
- [ ] Implement proper pathfinding with Navigation2D
- [ ] Create test scene for player movement validation
- [ ] Enhance walkable area system with improved polygon algorithms (As a player, I want clear boundaries for where my character can walk, so that I don't experience frustration from attempting to navigate to inaccessible areas.)
- [ ] Implement click detection and validation refinements
- [ ] Create test scene for walkable area validation
- [ ] Enhance system communication through signals
- [ ] Implement comprehensive debug tools and visualizations
- [ ] Create integration test for full navigation system
- [ ] Create directory structure and base files for the multi-perspective system (As a developer, I want a well-organized foundation for the multi-perspective character system, so that we can build and extend it systematically with minimal refactoring.)
- [ ] Define perspective types enum and configuration templates
- [ ] Extend district base class to support perspective information
- [ ] Implement character controller class with animation support (As a player, I want my character's appearance to adapt correctly to different visual perspectives, so that the game maintains visual consistency and immersion.)
- [ ] Create test character with basic animations
- [ ] Test animation transitions within a perspective
- [ ] Implement movement controller with direction support (As a player, I want my character to move correctly regardless of the visual perspective, so that gameplay feels consistent throughout the game.)
- [ ] Connect movement controller to point-and-click navigation
- [ ] Test character movement in a single perspective
- [ ] Create test districts with different perspective types
- [ ] Implement perspective switching in character controller
- [ ] Create test for transitions between different perspective districts
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for both systems (As a developer, I want clear documentation for both the navigation and multi-perspective systems, so that I can understand, maintain, and extend these systems effectively.)
- [ ] Perform code review and optimization
- [ ] Update existing documentation to reflect new systems
- [ ] Create simple POC test sprites for perspective scaling validation (As a developer, I want simple geometric test sprites at multiple scales, so that I can validate the perspective scaling system without complex art assets.)
- [ ] Implement basic sprite perspective scaling system (As a developer, I want sprites to scale based on Y-position in perspective backgrounds, so that depth illusion is maintained in scenes with visual perspective.)
- [ ] Create sprite scaling test scene for validation (As a developer, I want a dedicated test scene for sprite scaling, so that I can validate perspective effects work correctly with different backgrounds and movement patterns.)
- [ ] Implement diegetic audio scaling system for perspective immersion (As a player, I want environmental sounds to naturally fade and pan based on my position and distance, so that the game world feels spatially realistic and immersive.)
- [ ] Create audio system directory structure and core architecture (As a developer, I want to establish the foundational audio system architecture and file structure, so that all future audio development builds on a solid, well-organized base.)
- [ ] Implement basic AudioManager singleton (As a developer, I want a central AudioManager singleton that tracks the player's position and manages all diegetic audio sources, so that audio can respond dynamically to player movement.)
- [ ] Create simplified DiegeticAudioController component (As a developer, I want a reusable audio component that automatically adjusts volume based on distance from the player, so that we can easily add spatial audio to any game object.)
- [ ] Integrate audio with perspective scaling system (As a player, I want audio volume to reflect not just distance but also the visual perspective scale, so that sounds feel naturally integrated with the visual depth of the scene.)
- [ ] Create audio foundation test scene and verify integration (As a developer, I want a comprehensive test scene for the audio MVP, so that I can verify all audio systems work correctly and establish a testing baseline for future development.)

## Progress Tracking

## Notes
- Analyzed sprite perspective scaling plan (docs/design/sprite_perspective_scaling_plan.md) and determined it is an MVP implementation. Created full implementation design document (docs/design/sprite_perspective_scaling_full_plan.md) and Iteration 11 plan with 42 tasks across 7 phases. Full system includes: intelligent zone generation from backgrounds, advanced visual effects (LOD, deformation, shadows), sophisticated movement systems, professional editor tools, and comprehensive performance optimization.
- Created comprehensive foreground occlusion system design documents: MVP (docs/design/foreground_occlusion_mvp_plan.md) and Full (docs/design/foreground_occlusion_full_plan.md). Added 5 MVP tasks to Iteration 3 (Tasks 37-41) and created Iteration 10 with 24 tasks for full implementation. System provides Y-position based occlusion for MVP, expanding to polygon-based zones with visual editing tools in full version.
