# Development Session: Iteration 3 Task 3: Dialog System Refactoring
**Date:** May 22, 2025
**Time:** 15:28:02
**Iteration:** 3 - Navigation Refactoring and Multi-Perspective Character System
**Task Focus:** Refactor dialog system for multi-perspective support

## Session Goals
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create test scene for validating camera system improvements
- [ ] Enhance player controller for consistent physics behavior (As a player, I want my character to move naturally with smooth acceleration and deceleration, so that navigation feels responsive and realistic.)
- [ ] Implement proper pathfinding with Navigation2D
- [ ] Create test scene for player movement validation
- [ ] Enhance walkable area system with improved polygon algorithms (As a player, I want clear boundaries for where my character can walk, so that I don't experience frustration from attempting to navigate to inaccessible areas.)
- [ ] Implement click detection and validation refinements
- [ ] Create test scene for walkable area validation
- [ ] Enhance system communication through signals
- [ ] Implement comprehensive debug tools and visualizations
- [ ] Create integration test for full navigation system
- [ ] Create directory structure and base files for the multi-perspective system (As a developer, I want a well-organized foundation for the multi-perspective character system, so that we can build and extend it systematically with minimal refactoring.)
- [ ] Define perspective types enum and configuration templates
- [ ] Extend district base class to support perspective information
- [ ] Implement character controller class with animation support (As a player, I want my character's appearance to adapt correctly to different visual perspectives, so that the game maintains visual consistency and immersion.)
- [ ] Create test character with basic animations
- [ ] Test animation transitions within a perspective
- [ ] Implement movement controller with direction support (As a player, I want my character to move correctly regardless of the visual perspective, so that gameplay feels consistent throughout the game.)
- [ ] Connect movement controller to point-and-click navigation
- [ ] Test character movement in a single perspective
- [ ] Create test districts with different perspective types
- [ ] Implement perspective switching in character controller
- [ ] Create test for transitions between different perspective districts
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for both systems (As a developer, I want clear documentation for both the navigation and multi-perspective systems, so that I can understand, maintain, and extend these systems effectively.)
- [ ] Perform code review and optimization
- [ ] Update existing documentation to reflect new systems
