# Development Session: Iteration 3 Unit Testing
**Date:** May 19, 2025
**Time:** 08:06:37
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Camera Unit Tests & Test Infrastructure

## Session Goals
- Fix critical unit test issues and improve test infrastructure
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Modify test runner script to increase timeout for complex tests
- [ ] Review and improve unit test implementation for camera state management
- [ ] Enhance test runner script for better error handling and reporting
- [ ] Fix resource loading issues in test scene files (improper ExtResource format)
- [ ] Fix the naming conflict between log() function and GDScript's built-in log() function
- [ ] Fix parse errors and resource loading issues in unit test files
- [ ] 

## Notes
- Enhanced the test runner script with several improvements: (1) Increased default timeout from 30s to 60s for all tests, (2) Added support for running specific tests via command-line arguments, (3) Added extended timeout multiplier for complex tests that need more time, (4) Added better command output for debugging.
- Unit tests after fixes still have some issues: (1) bounds_calculator_test.gd has a parameter count mismatch in create_bounds_visualization() call, (2) camera_state_test.gd has an issue with ScrollingCamera instantiation - the script cannot be instantiated directly, (3) camera_walkable_integration_test.gd still has a parse error with line breaks.
- Fixed parse errors in bounds_calculator_test.gd and camera_state_test.gd by converting multi-line boolean expressions to single-line expressions to avoid GDScript's issues with line breaks in expressions.
- No log() function renaming needed - all test files are already using debug_log() for their logging. This appears to have been fixed in a previous commit but may not have been fully tested.
- Fixed resource loading issues in camera_state_test.tscn, coordinate_conversion_test.tscn, and scrolling_camera_test.tscn by properly declaring the scrolling_camera.gd script as an external resource and referencing it correctly with ExtResource(2) instead of using a string path.
- Previous session identified several critical issues with unit tests: (1) Naming conflict between custom log() function and GDScript's built-in mathematical log() function, which must be fixed by renaming to debug_log(). (2) Test scenes have incorrect resource loading syntax, using double quotes in ExtResource calls. (3) Parse errors that need to be fixed for all test files.
