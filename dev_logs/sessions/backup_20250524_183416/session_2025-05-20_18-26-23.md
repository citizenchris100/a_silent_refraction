# Development Session: Unit Test Evaluation
**Date:** May 20, 2025
**Time:** 18:26:23
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Identifying and fixing failing unit tests

## Session Goals
- Document passing tests for reference
- Identify failing tests and create tasks to fix them
- Run all unit tests to verify current status
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Notes
- COMMON ISSUE: All failing tests have timeout issues. Common causes may include: infinite loops, yield statements that never complete, missing signals, or resource loading that hangs. The fix strategy should focus on ensuring all tests have proper timeouts and clean exit paths.
- PRIORITY: Fix the view_mode_transition_test timeout first, as this is likely related to coordinate system issues that could affect other tests.
- TEST SUMMARY: 5 passing test suites (bounds_calculator_test, camera_state_test, coordinate_conversion_test, coordinate_manager_test, scrolling_camera_test) and 4 failing tests that time out (camera_walkable_integration_test, coordinate_system_test, coordinate_transformation_test, view_mode_transition_test).
- view_mode_transition_test: TIMEOUT - Test execution exceeded the 60-second limit
- scrolling_camera_test: PASSED (19/19 tests passing)
- coordinate_transformation_test: TIMEOUT - Test execution exceeded the 60-second limit
- coordinate_system_test: TIMEOUT - Test execution exceeded the 60-second limit
- coordinate_manager_test: PASSED (10/10 tests passing)
- coordinate_conversion_test: PASSED (15/15 tests passing)
- camera_walkable_integration_test: TIMEOUT - Test execution exceeded the 2-minute limit
- camera_state_test: PASSED (15/15 tests passing)
- bounds_calculator_test: PASSED (10/10 tests passing)
- 

## Next Steps
- Fix camera_walkable_integration_test last, as it's a complex integration test that may depend on fixing the underlying coordinate system tests first
- After fixing view_mode_transition_test, prioritize coordinate_system_test and coordinate_transformation_test, as they likely share common issues
- Begin by examining the view_mode_transition_test.gd script to identify potential infinite loops or incomplete yield statements
