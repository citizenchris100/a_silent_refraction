# Development Session: Iteration Planner Enhancements
**Date:** May 16, 2025
**Time:** 12:25:05
**Iteration:** 2 - NPC Framework, Suspicion System, and Initial Asset Creation
**Task Focus:** Requirements Integration

## Session Goals
- Enhance iteration planner to integrate requirements at both iteration (Epic) and task (User Story) levels
- Design and implement the structure for requirements sections
- Test the enhanced functionality

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Implement scrolling camera system for wide backgrounds
- [ ] Design Shipping District main floor background with animated elements
- [ ] Create Docked Ship USCSS Theseus background (player starting location)
- [ ] Create Player character sprites (front, side, back views)
- [ ] Create assimilated variant of Player character sprites
- [ ] Create Security Officer sprites (standard, suspicious, hostile states)
- [ ] Create assimilated variants of Security Officer sprites
- [ ] Design NPC sprite template with state transitions
- [ ] Create Bank Teller sprites (initial quest NPC)
- [ ] Create assimilated variant of Bank Teller sprites
- [ ] Create Player's room (Room 306) background
- [ ] Perform in-game integration testing of all Iteration 2 features

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Consistent Debug Groups - Establish standardized naming conventions for debug-related node groups with documentation
- [x] Debug Command System - Implement a more structured debug command system for runtime toggling of debug features like camera visualization
- [x] Debug Singleton Documentation - Add clear architecture comments to debug_singleton.gd explaining the overall system and component interactions
- [x] Debug Loader Cleanup - Update debug_loader.gd to remove references to the now-deleted debug_overlay.gd and use the current architecture
- [x] Simple Coordinate Picker Evaluation - Evaluate if simple_coordinate_picker.gd is still needed alongside coordinate_picker.gd or if they should be merged
- [x] Test the enhanced iteration planner functionality
- [x] Implement modifications to iteration_planner.sh
- [x] Design requirements section for tasks (User Stories)
- [x] Design requirements section for iterations (Epics)
- [x] Analyze the current iteration_planner.sh structure
- [x] Update documentation for the enhanced iteration planner

## Notes
- After analyzing the current iteration_planner.sh, I've identified that the script already has a structured approach for iterations with Goals, Tasks, and Testing Criteria sections. It needs to be enhanced to include formal Requirements sections at both iteration and task levels.
- Created two template files to define the structure for requirements:
  - `/docs/iteration_requirements_template.md` - Defines the Epic-level requirements structure with Business Requirements, User Requirements, and optional Technical Requirements
  - `/docs/task_requirements_template.md` - Defines the User Story format for individual tasks with acceptance criteria and implementation notes
- The iteration requirements follow a structured format with rationales and success metrics, while task requirements follow the standard user story format: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
- Designed a linkage system between tasks and iteration-level requirements using requirement IDs (B1, U2, etc.) to maintain traceability
- Implemented enhancements to iteration_planner.sh (saved as iteration_planner.sh.new) with the following additions:
  - Added a Requirements section between Goals and Tasks in iteration templates
  - Created structured format for Business, User, and Technical requirements
  - Added user story templates for tasks with acceptance criteria
  - Added new commands:
    - `add-req` to add requirements to iterations
    - `add-story` to add user stories to tasks
  - Enhanced progress reporting to include key requirements
  - Added user story information in task listings
- Successfully tested all enhancements using a test script that verified:
  - Creation of iterations with requirements sections
  - Adding various types of requirements
  - Adding user stories to tasks
  - Generating reports with requirements included
- Created comprehensive documentation in `/docs/iteration_planner_guide.md` explaining the enhanced system, commands, and best practices

## Next Steps
- Replace the existing iteration_planner.sh with the enhanced version (already created a backup as iteration_planner.sh.bak)
- Apply the new requirements structure to existing iterations
- Address the pending debug system tasks in future sessions

## Time Log
- Started: 12:25:05
- Ended: 13:45:30

## Summary
Enhanced the iteration planner with a comprehensive requirements management system that operates at both Epic and User Story levels. This system follows industry best practices by structuring business, user, and technical requirements with clear rationales and success metrics. Implemented user story format for task-level requirements with a traceability system that links back to Epic-level requirements. Added new commands for managing requirements and created detailed documentation. All functionality was successfully tested with a custom test script.
