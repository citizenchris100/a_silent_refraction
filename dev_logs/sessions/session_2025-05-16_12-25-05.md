## Progress Tracking

- [x] Debug Loader Cleanup - Update debug_loader.gd to remove references to the now-deleted debug_overlay.gd and use the current architecture
- [x] Simple Coordinate Picker Evaluation - Evaluate if simple_coordinate_picker.gd is still needed alongside coordinate_picker.gd or if they should be merged
- [x] Test the enhanced iteration planner functionality
- [x] Implement modifications to iteration_planner.sh
- [x] Design requirements section for tasks (User Stories)
- [x] Design requirements section for iterations (Epics)
- [x] Analyze the current iteration_planner.sh structure
- [x] Update documentation for the enhanced iteration planner

## Notes
- After analyzing the current iteration_planner.sh, I've identified that the script already has a structured approach for iterations with Goals, Tasks, and Testing Criteria sections. It needs to be enhanced to include formal Requirements sections at both iteration and task levels.
- Created two template files to define the structure for requirements:
  - `/docs/iteration_requirements_template.md` - Defines the Epic-level requirements structure with Business Requirements, User Requirements, and optional Technical Requirements
  - `/docs/task_requirements_template.md` - Defines the User Story format for individual tasks with acceptance criteria and implementation notes
- The iteration requirements follow a structured format with rationales and success metrics, while task requirements follow the standard user story format: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
- Designed a linkage system between tasks and iteration-level requirements using requirement IDs (B1, U2, etc.) to maintain traceability
- Implemented enhancements to iteration_planner.sh (saved as iteration_planner.sh.new) with the following additions:
  - Added a Requirements section between Goals and Tasks in iteration templates
  - Created structured format for Business, User, and Technical requirements
  - Added user story templates for tasks with acceptance criteria
  - Added new commands:
    - `add-req` to add requirements to iterations
    - `add-story` to add user stories to tasks
  - Enhanced progress reporting to include key requirements
  - Added user story information in task listings
- Successfully tested all enhancements using a test script that verified:
  - Creation of iterations with requirements sections
  - Adding various types of requirements
  - Adding user stories to tasks
  - Generating reports with requirements included
- Created comprehensive documentation in `/docs/iteration_planner_guide.md` explaining the enhanced system, commands, and best practices

## Debug System Analysis
Based on review of the debug system components, here's an analysis of the outstanding TODOs:

### 1. Consistent Debug Groups (#7) - Establish standardized naming conventions

**Current Status:**
- The debug system uses a few different groups like "walkable_area" for tracking objects
- The debug approach is currently not standardized across the codebase
- There's no clear documentation of what debug groups exist or how they should be named

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Create a formal registry of debug groups with standardized naming conventions
- Document the purpose and usage of each group in a central location
- Implement consistent group assignment in debug_manager.gd and related files
- Update existing code to use standardized group names

### 2. Debug Command System (#8) - Implement structured debug command system

**Current Status:**
- Commands are registered in debug_console.gd with register_command()
- The debug_singleton.gd has a simple command execution handler
- Commands are implemented in a relatively ad-hoc manner
- Limited categorization and organization of commands

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Create a more structured command system with categories and help documentation
- Implement command autocomplete in the console
- Centralize command registration in debug_singleton
- Add support for command aliases and shortcuts
- Implement a formal command API with standardized parameters and return values
- Add better error handling and feedback for command execution

### 3. Debug Singleton Documentation (#9) - Add architecture comments

**Current Status:**
- The debug_singleton.gd has minimal documentation
- The architectural relationship between components is not clearly explained
- Missing information on how to properly extend the debug system

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Add comprehensive class and method documentation
- Document the architectural relationship between debug components
- Provide usage examples for different debug scenarios
- Create a clear API reference for other developers to follow
- Document the signal system and event flow in the debug architecture

### 4. Debug Loader Cleanup (#10) - Update to use current architecture

**Current Status:**
- debug_loader.gd appears to be an older approach to loading debug tools
- There's some redundancy between it and the newer debug_singleton.gd approach
- Documentation marks some debug components as deprecated

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Refactor debug_loader.gd to align with the current architecture
- Remove deprecated methods and references
- Ensure consistent API usage across the codebase
- Update or merge with debug_singleton.gd as appropriate
- Clean up unused or redundant code

### 5. Simple Coordinate Picker Evaluation (#11) - Evaluate if needed

**Current Status:**
- There are two coordinate pickers: coordinate_picker.gd and simple_coordinate_picker.gd
- They have overlapping functionality with slight differences
- simple_coordinate_picker.gd appears to be a streamlined version focused on walkable areas

**Suggested Improvements:**
- Evaluate whether both implementations are necessary
- Consider merging functionality into a single, configurable component
- If both are needed, clearly document the purpose and use cases for each
- Ensure consistent API between both implementations if both are kept
- Update documentation to explain when to use each picker

The debug system appears to need standardization, consolidation, and better documentation. The TODOs reflect these needs, with a focus on improving the architecture, command system, and documentation to make the debug tools more maintainable and easier to use.

## Next Steps
- Replace the existing iteration_planner.sh with the enhanced version (already created a backup as iteration_planner.sh.bak)
- Apply the new requirements structure to existing iterations
- Address the pending debug system tasks in future sessions

## Time Log
- Started: 12:25:05
- Ended: 13:45:30

## Summary
Enhanced the iteration planner with a comprehensive requirements management system that operates at both Epic and User Story levels. This system follows industry best practices by structuring business, user, and technical requirements with clear rationales and success metrics. Implemented user story format for task-level requirements with a traceability system that links back to Epic-level requirements. Added new commands for managing requirements and created detailed documentation. All functionality was successfully tested with a custom test script.
