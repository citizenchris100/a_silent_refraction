## Notes
- READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION PHASE - All behavioral contracts are now defined through tests. Next steps: 1) Implement InputManager validation methods to match mock contract. 2) Create visual feedback system matching component test contract. 3) Create click priority system matching test expectations. 4) Add tolerance/perspective methods to CoordinateManager. Once implemented, the subsystem test should pass with 0 failures.
- ALL TEST COVERAGE GAPS FILLED - Successfully created comprehensive tests that define behavioral contracts for Task 8 implementation. Created 4 new test files: click_tolerance_test.gd (11 passing tests defining tolerance behavior), click_perspective_test.gd (10 passing tests defining zoom/perspective effects), click_feedback_component_test.gd (12 passing tests defining visual feedback), click_signal_component_test.gd (3 passing tests defining signal flow). Total: 36 new passing tests defining complete contracts. The subsystem test's 5 failures now clearly indicate what production code needs to be implemented.
- CORRECTION: Using proper three-tier testing terminology - Unit Tests (1 component), Component Tests (2-3 components), Subsystem Tests (4+ components). The cross-system signal communication tests should be COMPONENT tests since they involve 2-3 components working together, not integration tests.
- TEST COVERAGE GAPS IDENTIFIED - Task 8 tests establish structural contracts but lack behavioral contracts. PARTIALLY COVERED: 1) Perspective/zoom click adjustment - test expects method but doesn't define behavior. 2) Visual feedback system - test expects file but doesn't define appearance/behavior. MISSING COVERAGE: 1) Click tolerance behavior - no tests define tolerance values or adjustment logic. 2) Cross-system coordination - no tests verify signal emission or system communication. Need additional tests to define these behavioral contracts.
- Created properly failing subsystem test. The simplified version (click_interaction_subsystem_simple_test.gd) clearly shows 5 failures: InputManager lacks validation methods, visual feedback system doesn't exist, click priority system doesn't exist, no click tolerance, no perspective/zoom awareness. This provides clear direction for implementation.
- Created all three test tiers: Unit test (click_detection_test.gd), Component test (input_coordinate_component_test.gd), and Subsystem test (click_interaction_subsystem_test.gd). All tests follow project standards. Unit and Component tests pass with mocks defining the spec. Subsystem test has some issues but demonstrates the full end-to-end testing approach for 7+ components.
- Created first unit test: click_detection_test.gd following project standards. Test passes with mock implementation, providing the blueprint for actual implementation. Fixed several issues: variable scoping, dialog panel setup, and removed async yields for synchronous testing.
- TDD IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: 1) Write failing unit tests first for each acceptance criteria. 2) Implement minimal code to make unit tests pass. 3) Write component tests to verify integration. 4) Refine implementation to pass component tests. 5) Write subsystem tests for complete workflows. 6) Add visual feedback and debug features. 7) Optimize performance based on test results. This ensures we build exactly what is needed with confidence.
- KEY TEST SCENARIOS: Edge cases (screen boundaries, during camera movement, rapid clicks, different zoom levels, World vs Game View, overlapping objects, outside walkable areas). Visual feedback (marker at click, colors for valid/invalid, adjustment lines, clearing feedback, performance). Priority system (objects over movement, z-order, NPCs over static, UI blocks game clicks).
- SUBSYSTEM TEST PLAN: click_interaction_subsystem_test.gd - Test full click-to-action flow (Click to Validate to Priority to Feedback to Action). Test with various districts, edge cases (clicking during camera movement), and performance under rapid clicking. This tests 4+ components working together.
- COMPONENT TESTS PLAN: 1) input_coordinate_component_test.gd - Test InputManager + CoordinateManager (screen-to-world conversion, validation pipeline, different camera states). 2) click_feedback_component_test.gd - Test validation + visual feedback (marker creation, valid/invalid indicators, adjustment visualization). 3) click_object_component_test.gd - Test InputManager + Object detection (clicking interactive objects, overlapping objects, priority resolution).
- UNIT TESTS PLAN: 1) click_detection_test.gd - Test InputManager click detection (position validation, UI element detection, dialog state checking, click blocking). 2) click_validation_test.gd - Test validation algorithms (tolerance calculations, perspective/zoom adjustments, boundary validation, coordinate range validation). 3) click_priority_test.gd - Test priority system (object vs movement priority, z-order handling, clickable area overlap detection).
- TESTING STRATEGY FOR TASK 8 - OVERVIEW: Following TDD principles, create tests BEFORE implementing refinements. This ensures we define expected behavior first, then implement to make tests pass. Using three-tier testing approach: Unit Tests for single components, Component Tests for 2-3 components, Subsystem Tests for 4+ components.
- Testing Strategy for Task 8 - Click Detection Refinements: Will use a three-tier approach with Unit Tests for coordinate transformations, Component Tests for click-to-action flow, and Subsystem Tests for complete click interaction scenarios
- Reviewed system documentation. Key findings: Current click flow is PlayerController->CoordinateManager->Player->District validation. Missing visual feedback, debug visualization, and comprehensive tests for click detection.
- Correcting focus: Task 8 is 'Implement click detection and validation refinements', not the walkable area test scene (which is Task 9)
