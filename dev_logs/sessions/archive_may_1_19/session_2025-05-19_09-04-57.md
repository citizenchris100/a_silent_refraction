# Development Session: Iteration 3 Unit Testing - Final Fixes
**Date:** May 19, 2025
**Time:** 09:04:57
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Resolving Bounds Calculator Test Issues

## Session Goals
- Fix remaining issues in the BoundsCalculator test to make the full test suite run successfully
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Fix 'Invalid get index polygon on base Node2D' error in BoundsCalculator test
- [ ] 

## Notes
- Updated the create_polygon_node function to directly set the polygon property on the node using node.set() rather than trying to use a script. The issue was that the indentation in the multi-line string for the script was causing a parse error 'Unexpected indentation', and even when fixed, the script wasn't being properly loaded before the test tried to access the polygon property.
- Fixed the 'Invalid get index polygon' error in BoundsCalculator test by revising the create_polygon_node function to properly implement the expected structure. The BoundsCalculator expects walkable areas to have a 'polygon' property directly on the node, but our test was creating nodes with CollisionPolygon2D children. The fix adds a script to the test nodes that exposes the polygon property in the way the BoundsCalculator expects.
- Previous sessions fixed parsing issues, resource loading problems, and camera instantiation issues across the test suite. However, the BoundsCalculator test is still failing with 'Invalid get index polygon' errors. This suggests that the mock walkable areas created in the test aren't properly structured to match what the BoundsCalculator expects.
