## Notes
- NEW ISSUE (debug014.png): The latest test shows a major regression with the camera system. The entire screen is filled with just a large green rectangle (the walkable area), which is taking up almost the entire viewport. The background image is not visible at all. The camera position is at (1746, 938.5) with the player at (1836, 248), and the screen shows "View: 58% visible" even though nothing but the green walkable area polygon is visible. This suggests several issues: 1) The walkable area coordinates may be incorrect; 2) The camera position calculation is not working properly; 3) The background image loading or positioning might be failing.

- IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE (scrolling_camera.gd): Identified a flaw in _ensure_player_visible() function that could cause an infinite loop. The function adjusts the camera position if the player is outside view, but the calculation for the adjusted position was incorrect. When calculating the direction from player to center, it created a vector pointing away from the player rather than toward the player's position, potentially causing oscillation. We fixed this by simplifying the approach to directly center on the player when they're outside the camera view.

- IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE (scrolling_camera.gd): Discovered a potential infinite loop in the camera adjustment logic. When the player is near the edge of the camera bounds, _ensure_player_visible() and _handle_camera_movement() may continuously try to adjust the camera position, getting stuck in a "Player outside camera view - adjusting camera position" loop. We implemented a fix to break this cycle by checking if target position was significantly clamped due to bounds before calling _ensure_player_visible().

- FIXED: Fixed the 'Invalid call. Nonexistent function duplicate in base PoolVector2Array' error by replacing the call to duplicate() with a manual copy operation. In Godot 3.5, PoolVector2Array doesn't have a duplicate() method, so we need to manually iterate through the points and create a new array. We've also captured the newly generated walkable area coordinates from our test run which more accurately reflect the visible floor in the scene: (360, 600), (361, 638), (899, 634), (898, 603).

- TEST RESULTS: Our fix has been partially successful! In the latest debug image (debug013.png), we can see: 1) The walkable area is now properly positioned at the floor level, visible as a semi-transparent green overlay on the shipping dock floor; 2) The background image is now visible, showing the shipping dock scene; 3) Camera bounds are now correctly calculated as (0, 0, 2448, 496) rather than the tiny height we saw previously; 4) We've captured new coordinates for the walkable area at (360, 600), (361, 638), (899, 634), (898, 603) which match the visible floor. However, we still have one error: 'Invalid call. Nonexistent function duplicate in base PoolVector2Array' which needs fixing in the walkable area setup.
- TESTING PLAN: To verify our attempted fixes, we need to test the following: 1) Run the camera test scene with ./a_silent_refraction.sh camera; 2) Check if the walkable area appears correctly positioned at the floor level rather than at the top of the screen; 3) Confirm the bounds calculation in the console output shows reasonable dimensions; 4) Verify the player remains visible during scrolling; 5) Test smooth scrolling when the player approaches screen edges.
- ATTEMPTED SOLUTION: We've implemented potential fixes for the walkable area and camera bounds issues that need testing: 1) Completely redesigned the _calculate_district_bounds() method with detailed debugging, validation checks, and fallback mechanisms to detect and correct problematic bounds; 2) Updated walkable area coordinates based on debug012.png analysis to use (10, 545) to (1137, 580) instead of the previous values; 3) Added safety checks for minimum width/height; 4) Added explicit yield + force_update_scroll() to ensure immediate camera updates after coordinate changes.
- SOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION: We've fixed the walkable area and camera bounds issues by: 1) Completely redesigning the _calculate_district_bounds() method with detailed debugging, validation checks, and fallback mechanisms to ensure proper bounds calculation; 2) Using coordinate values derived from debug012.png (10, 545) to (1137, 580) for the walkable area instead of the previous values; 3) Adding safety checks that enforce minimum width/height and detect problematic bounds calculations; 4) Properly forcing camera bounds updates with yield + force_update_scroll().
- SOLUTION APPROACH: We need to fix the _calculate_district_bounds method in scrolling_camera.gd. The issue may be either: 1) In how we calculate the Rect2 from polygon points (expand method may not be working correctly); 2) The to_global conversion isn't properly calculating global positions; or 3) The walkable area polygon itself may have incorrect coordinates due to a mismatch between test and camera coordinate spaces. We'll add debug visualization, manually verify coordinates, and implement a fallback safety check for abnormally small bounds.
- HYPOTHESIS: The main issue appears to be with the _calculate_district_bounds method. The walkable area polygon from the test scene defines points at (1, 600), (1327, 602), etc., but the resulting camera bounds (1, 600, 1326, 33) has a height of only 33 pixels, which is incredibly small. The height should be closer to 33-35 pixels based on the original coordinates. This suggests the bounds calculation is not properly expanding the Rect2 object with the polygon's points.
- Based on debug012.png analysis, we've identified several related issues: 1) The walkable area coordinates from previous tests (1, 600), (1327, 602), etc. appear to be incorrectly mapped to screen space; 2) The background image is out of view entirely; 3) The player's Y-coordinate (248) is much higher than expected (previously around 600); 4) The camera system reports 107% visible even though the background isn't visible.
- CRITICAL ISSUE: Despite our coordinate conversion improvements, the walkable area is still appearing at the top of the screen instead of the shipping dock floor area. As seen in debug012.png, the entire walkable area (green rectangle) is positioned at the top of the viewport with the background completely out of view. The debug information shows Camera: (615, 1042.5), Player: (1836, 248), which indicates something is still wrong with the coordinate system or initial positioning.
- Improved coordinate conversion with properly documented screen_to_world() and world_to_screen() helper methods in the camera class. These methods ensure consistent coordinate transformation regardless of zoom level and are now used by the coordinate picker for more reliable results.
- Fixed font rendering errors by implementing UI-based debug labels as an alternative to direct font rendering. Created _setup_debug_labels() and _update_debug_labels() methods that use Godot UI controls (Labels) instead of relying on font resources, which were causing 'p_font.is_null()' errors.
- Added player visibility protection with _ensure_player_visible() function. The camera now checks if the player is within the view after scrolling and adjusts position if needed to ensure the player character is never lost off-screen.
- Implemented smooth scrolling for camera when player reaches screen edges. Created an intelligent scrolling system that calculates exactly how far past the edge the player has moved and adjusts the camera position proportionally. This creates a natural scrolling effect that feels responsive yet smooth with the selected easing function.
- Fixed coordinate conversion issues in debug tools when using zoomed-out view. We identified the issue where coordinates captured in zoomed-out view were being incorrectly applied to the walkable area. Added debug output for coordinate conversion process and implemented a camera.screen_to_world() helper method to ensure consistent coordinate conversion.
- Reference image debug029.png shows the entire background visible at once
- The background is intended to be twice the display area size
- Initial camera position should be configurable (left, right, center, etc.)
- Camera should scroll to show other parts of the scene when player reaches the edges
- Player character should remain visible during and after scrolling
- Need precise walkable area definition with debug tools

### Progress Updates

#### Camera Interpolation with Easing Functions
- Implemented multiple easing function types in `scrolling_camera.gd`
- Added enum for easing types: LINEAR, EASE_IN, EASE_OUT, EASE_IN_OUT, EXPONENTIAL, SINE, ELASTIC, CUBIC, QUAD
- Created `_apply_easing()` function that applies different mathematical formulas based on the selected easing type
- Connected UI to dynamically switch between easing types with 'E' key for testing
- Added visual indicators in debug mode to show current easing function

#### Debug Tools for Walkable Areas
- Enhanced `coordinate_picker.gd` to capture coordinates when clicking in the scene
- Fixed logging issues by adding multiple redundant logging methods (console, file, and visual)
- Implemented conversion from screen to world coordinates to account for camera zoom and position
- Added visual notification system to display captured coordinates
- Created test walkable area using the debug tools with coordinates (1, 600), (1327, 602), (1327, 633), (1, 631)

#### Fixed Initial Camera View
- Corrected a fundamental misunderstanding about Godot's camera zoom (higher values = zoomed out, not in)
- Implemented the 'V' key toggle to switch between partial view and full background view
- Fixed `_set_initial_camera_position()` to properly handle different initial view settings (left, right, center)
- Added warning when background isn't wide enough for proper scrolling effect
- Implemented `force_update_scroll()` method to immediately update camera position without animation

### Issues Discovered
- Found that the `OS.print_error()` function doesn't exist in Godot 3.5, replaced with `push_error()`
- Discovered background not wide enough warning in the camera test scene: "Warning: Background not wide enough for scrolling - centering instead"
- Found unusual camera bounds: "Camera bounds set from district: (1, 600, 1326, 33)" - not matching expected background size
- Encountered font rendering errors: "ERROR: Condition "p_font.is_null()" is true"

### Animation System Cleanup Notes (For Future Sessions)

#### Script Inconsistencies
- Inconsistency between `/tools/process_animation_frames.sh` (follows canonical workflow) and `/generate_animation_frames.sh` (uses simpler approach)
- Multiple testing scripts (`/run_animation_test.sh` and `/tools/test_animation.sh`) use different approaches

#### Implementation vs. Documentation Gap
- The actual `animated_background_manager.gd` code is simpler than what's described in documentation
- Currently uses placeholder animations rather than the full featured system described
- Missing advanced features:
  - No implementation of color keying/compositing (the cyan window areas)
  - No shader-based effects as described in documentation
  - Missing state management for animations
  - Custom element types not implemented
- Configuration format mismatch between code and documentation

#### Future Cleanup Approach
- Mark comprehensive documentation as "Planned Implementation" to set expectations
- Standardize on a single approach for animation processing and testing
- Create a clear roadmap for implementing missing features
- Develop specific documentation for cyan window keying technique

## Next Steps
- Fix the regression identified in debug014.png by:
  1. Investigating why the background image is not visible
  2. Correcting the walkable area coordinates to be a reasonable size at the bottom of the screen
  3. Reviewing camera position calculation to ensure it's not zoomed in too far on the green area
- Test camera scrolling behavior with the corrected setup to verify our fixes for the infinite loop issue
- Review all coordinate space transformations to ensure consistency between camera view, walkable area, and background
- Consider testing with a simpler, solid-color background to isolate positioning issues

## Summary
This session focused on fixing issues with the camera system in our point-and-click adventure game. We made significant progress implementing multiple easing functions for smooth camera movement and fixing coordinate conversion issues. We also identified and fixed a bug with the PoolVector2Array.duplicate() method by implementing manual array copying.

Our most important achievements were:
1. Implementing comprehensive debug visualization and coordinate conversion helpers to diagnose issues
2. Improving camera bounds calculation with safety checks and validation
3. Fixing infinite loop issues in the camera adjustment logic
4. Adding player visibility protection to ensure the player character is never lost off-screen

However, we still have a major issue to resolve as shown in debug014.png, where the walkable area is taking up the entire screen and the background image is not visible. This indicates we may need to revisit our walkable area coordinate system or camera initialization. Despite this setback, we've gathered valuable information about the coordinate system and behavior of the camera that will help us resolve this issue in the next session.
