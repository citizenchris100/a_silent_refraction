# Development Session: Camera Bug Investigation
**Date:** May 21, 2025
**Time:** 16:36:45
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Identifying and fixing camera system bugs found by integration tests

## Session Goals
- Fix all 5 identified camera system bugs to make camera_walkable_integration_test pass
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Investigate BUG5: BoundsCalculator integration issues
- [ ] Investigate BUG4: Bounds enforcement not working in move_to_position
- [x] Investigate BUG3: update_bounds method not working
- [x] Investigate BUG2: Bounds containment edge case with has_point
- [ ] Investigate BUG1: Camera bounds calculation not being stored
- [ ] 

## Notes
- BUG 3 FIXED: update_bounds method now works with any parent that has walkable_areas property, not just BaseDistrict. Added test coverage for update_bounds method to scrolling_camera_test. All camera_walkable_integration_test and scrolling_camera_test now pass.
- BUG1 ROOT CAUSE FOUND: _calculate_district_bounds() returns calculated bounds but never stores them in camera_bounds property. The method should both return AND store the results for consistency with test expectations and proper functionality.
- CAMERA BUGS IDENTIFIED: 5 bugs found in ScrollingCamera system from integration tests. BUG1: Camera bounds calculation not stored in camera.camera_bounds property. BUG2: Bounds containment logic edge case with has_point(). BUG3: update_bounds() method not working. BUG4: Bounds enforcement not working in move_to_position(). BUG5: BoundsCalculator integration issues. All located in src/core/camera/scrolling_camera.gd
