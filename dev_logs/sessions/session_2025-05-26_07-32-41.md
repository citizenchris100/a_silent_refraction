- [ ] Create MorningReportManager to consolidate morning reports from save and sleep systems into single unified system
- [ ] Centralize all UI notifications by updating Sleep, Save, and Audio systems to use prompt_notification_system
- [ ] 

## Notes
- COMPLETED ALL TEMPLATE REFERENCE UPDATES! Successfully updated 16 design documents to reference their appropriate templates (NPCs, districts, quests, interactive objects, dialogs). This ensures consistent implementation patterns across the entire codebase and promotes code reuse.
- Completed template updates for: assimilation, job_work_quest, inventory, coalition_resistance, living_world_mvp, living_world_full, crime_security, investigation_clue, puzzle, district_access, tram_transportation, and multiple_endings. Total: 12 documents updated with template references.
- Progress update: Completed 9 template reference updates so far. Living world systems, crime/security, investigation, and puzzle systems now properly reference their template documents. This ensures consistent implementation patterns across these interconnected systems.
- Added 15 template reference update tasks to ensure all design documents properly reference their relevant templates. This will ensure consistent implementation patterns across all systems. Already completed template references for: assimilation_system, job_work_quest_system, inventory_system, and coalition_resistance_system.
- Completed template reference updates for assimilation_system, job_work_quest_system, and inventory_system. These now properly reference their respective template documents ensuring consistent implementation patterns.
- Task Status Clarification: Actually completed - Created morning_report_manager_design.md, system_integration_matrix.md, and updated sleep, save, barracks, quest_log, economy, and detection_game_over design docs to use PromptNotificationSystem. Also updated dialog_system_refactoring_plan. Warning redundancy has been eliminated. Outstanding tasks: (1) Update design docs to reference templates, (2) Create template integration standards, (3) Enhance audio system integration.
- Completed updating barracks_system_design.md to use PromptNotificationSystem for all notifications including rent payments, warnings, eviction notices, and readmittance confirmations. Also added system dependencies section.
- Template Document Integration is critical - many systems create NPCs, districts, objects, and quests but don't reference the templates. This leads to inconsistent implementations and missed opportunities for code reuse.
- Warning System Redundancy: Multiple systems (Sleep, Detection, Save) implement their own warning dialogs. Sleep system has midnight warnings, detection system has suspicion alerts, and save system has corruption warnings. All should use the prompt_notification_system's warning type instead of custom implementations.
- 

## Next Steps
- Enhance audio system integration to respond to game events (assimilation, detection, economic transactions)
- Create template integration standards document to ensure consistent implementation
- Complete remaining template updates (verb_ui, scumm_hover, disguise_clothing, economy, and any others missed)
