## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Fix navigation oscillation bug in player movement system
- [ ] 

## Notes
- TDD approach complete: Created failing integration test that reproduces navigation oscillation bug in 3 scenarios. Test suite healthy (221/222 pass). Ready to implement fix in player.gd _handle_movement() and _adjust_position_to_stay_in_bounds() functions.
- Key bug mechanism identified: Player approaches waypoint within 10px threshold, advances to next waypoint, but _adjust_position_to_stay_in_bounds() pushes back 5px when near boundaries, creating oscillation loop. Ready to implement fix in player.gd.
- Updated unit_testing_guide.md with comprehensive Integration Testing section covering when to use integration tests, patterns, and examples. Integration tests run through same infrastructure as unit tests.
- Integration test approach proved valuable - the bug emerges from interaction between multiple systems (navigation pathfinding, player movement physics, walkable area boundary checking). Test uses 30-pixel wide corridors with sharp 90-degree corners to reliably trigger the issue.
- Successfully created navigation oscillation integration test that reproduces the bug. Test shows player getting stuck in 3 different scenarios: 1) Complete stop without oscillating at corners, 2) Oscillating 4+ times in narrow corridors, 3) Excessive boundary pushbacks (18+). All existing tests still pass (221/222), only new integration test fails as expected.
- Removed redundant unit test files and updated unit_testing_guide.md with comprehensive instructions for setting up walkable areas in tests. Added specific guidance for Navigation2D setup, creating complex shapes for edge case testing (like L-shaped areas for corner navigation bugs), and troubleshooting common issues. The guide now includes proper examples of how to set up mock districts with walkable areas and navigation polygons for pathfinding tests.
- Analyzed navigation oscillation bug. From the GIFs and code inspection, I can see the player gets stuck oscillating when navigating around corners/curves. The issue appears to be in player.gd's _handle_movement() function. When the player approaches a waypoint (distance < 10), it advances to the next waypoint. However, if the player overshoots or gets pushed back by boundary checks in _adjust_position_to_stay_in_bounds(), it may repeatedly switch between waypoints, causing oscillation. The boundary adjustment pushes the player back 5 units when hitting non-walkable areas, which can put them back in range of the previous waypoint.
- Completed review of all required documentation. Key findings: 1) The game is a SCUMM-style point-and-click adventure with suspicion mechanics. 2) Architecture follows component-based design with minimal coupling and signal-based communication. 3) Iteration 3 focuses on navigation refactoring - Phase 1 revealed visual correctness must take priority over architectural purity (background scaling issue). 4) Navigation system uses point-and-click with pathfinding, walkable areas, and camera tracking. 5) Base district system is critical - all scenes must extend it for proper camera and coordinate functionality. 6) TDD approach requires test integrity first, then code integrity. Ready to analyze the navigation oscillation bug.
