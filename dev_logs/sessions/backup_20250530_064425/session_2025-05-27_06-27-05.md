## Notes
- Reordered tasks in Iteration 8 so that Tram Transportation System (MVP) tasks (26-30) now come before Intro Quest Implementation tasks (31-35). This makes logical sense as the tram system is needed for the intro quest which involves traveling from Spaceport to Engineering districts.
- Session complete. We successfully verified that all 53 design documents are now properly represented in iteration plans. Key accomplishments: Added time/calendar display UI tasks to I5, tram transportation tasks (MVP to I8, full to I10), puzzle system tasks to I15, and verified many other systems were already integrated. The phased approach (MVP in Phase 1, Full in Phase 2) is consistently applied throughout.
- Found that foreground occlusion is properly implemented across iterations: MVP version in Iteration 3 (Tasks 37-41) for Phase 1, and full implementation in Iteration 14 (Tasks 6-10) for Phase 2. The design document foreground_occlusion_full_plan.md is properly referenced in Iteration 14.
- Found that many design systems were already represented in their iterations: performance optimization tasks in Iteration 15 (Tasks 26-30), living world MVP in Iteration 8 (Tasks 16-20), sprite perspective scaling in Iteration 3 (Tasks 28-30), quest UI in Iteration 11 (Tasks 11-15), gender selection in Iteration 6 (Tasks 1-5), prompt notifications in Iteration 5 (Tasks 7-11), SCUMM hover text in Iteration 8 (Tasks 21-22). This indicates significant prior work integrating design documents into iteration plans.
- Found that character gender selection tasks were already in Iteration 6 (Tasks 1-5 for character creation system) and the main menu tasks were already added (Tasks 16-25). Several other design systems were already represented in their respective iterations.
- Found that sprite perspective scaling tasks were already in Iteration 3 (Tasks 28-30) and even include audio system MVP foundation tasks (31-35) for diegetic audio scaling with perspective. These appear to have been added in a previous session.
- Found that several tasks were already complete: time management MVP and prompt notification system were already in Iteration 5, and SCUMM hover text was already in Iteration 8. These must have been added in earlier sessions.
- Completed adding tram transportation system tasks. Added 5 MVP tasks to Iteration 8 (Phase 1) for basic tram functionality with fixed costs and simple UI. Added 10 full implementation tasks to Iteration 10 (Phase 2) including distance-based pricing, dynamic costs, transit events, passes, disruptions, security scanning, coalition benefits, and economic pressure. All tasks reference tram_transportation_system_design.md with appropriate MVP vs Full sections.
- Completed adding comprehensive time/calendar display UI tasks to Iteration 5. Added 10 new tasks (20-29) covering advanced UI features including minimal/expanded states, deadline warnings, calendar views, quest integration, assimilation countdown, contextual information, positioning system, flash warnings, serialization, and accessibility features. All tasks reference time_calendar_display_ui_design.md.
- Currently working on time/calendar display UI tasks for Iteration 5. Need to add comprehensive tasks based on time_calendar_display_ui_design.md that go beyond the basic clock/calendar UI tasks already present (tasks 12-13).
- Completed adding main menu UI tasks to Iteration 6. Added 10 new tasks (16-25) with comprehensive user stories covering title screen, save detection, gender selection, prologue system, and game initialization. All tasks reference main_menu_start_game_ui_design.md and integrate with existing systems.
- Added 23 tasks for all design documents that still need proper task implementation in their respective iterations. These tasks cover UI systems (main menu, time display, quest log, inventory, verb UI), gameplay systems (puzzles, disguises, gender selection, investigation, jobs), infrastructure (tram, access control, hover text), and technical implementations (performance, navigation, notifications, sprite scaling).
- Completed assignment of all 19 unrepresented design documents to appropriate iterations. Key placements: audio system (iteration 3), hardware validation (iteration 24), trading floor minigame (iteration 11), time management full (iteration 7), living world full (iteration 12). All template documents are now referenced where appropriate throughout iterations.
- Hardware Validation Plan (docs/design/hardware_validation_plan.md) is NOT represented in any iteration plan. This is a significant gap as it describes the entire distribution strategy as a purpose-built gaming appliance on Raspberry Pi 5.
- Found 53 design documents in docs/design/ directory. These cover a wide range of systems including assimilation, audio, UI, game mechanics, NPCs, quests, and technical implementations.
