# Development Session: Camera Architecture Refactoring
**Date:** May 19, 2025
**Time:** 13:21:17
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Implement bounds validation decoupling for improved testability

## Session Goals
- Complete the architectural improvements to decouple camera bounds validation from camera movement logic, making the camera component more testable while maintaining architectural alignment
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Run tests to validate improvements
- [ ] Update camera tests to use test_mode
- [ ] Refactor ScrollingCamera to use the validator pattern
- [ ] Implement TestBoundsValidator class
- [ ] Implement DefaultBoundsValidator class
- [ ] Create BoundsValidator interface class
- [ ]
