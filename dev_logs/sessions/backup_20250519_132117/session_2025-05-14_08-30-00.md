**Iteration:** 2
**Task Focus:** Animation Configuration System

## Session Goals
- Fix camera visualization and scrolling issues
- Implement animation configuration tools
- Document the animation system

## Progress Tracking

  ▶ Related files: docs/animation_system.md
- [x] Update existing documentation to reference the new animation tools
  ▶ Related files: docs/animated_background_workflow.md

## Notes
- FIXED: Walkable area visualization issue has been resolved by updating the coordinates in scrolling_camera_test.gd to use the values derived from debug013.png: (360, 600), (899, 603), (898, 634), (361, 638). These values match the visible floor area in the shipping dock scene.

- FIXED: Camera positioning has been corrected by adding safety checks to ensure the camera doesn't position itself too far from the walkable area. Added a new calculation to find the center of the walkable area and force the camera to stay within a reasonable distance.

- ENHANCEMENT: Improved the smooth scrolling logic when the player reaches screen edges. Now the camera adjusts more intelligently based on exactly how far the player has moved past the edge, creating a more natural scrolling effect.

- ENHANCEMENT: Significantly improved player visibility protection. The _ensure_player_visible() function now calculates precisely how far outside the view the player is and adds a small margin. Also added safety checks to handle edge cases such as NaN values or when the player is still outside view after adjustment.

- IMPLEMENTED: Created three new animation configuration tools:
  1. create_animation_config.sh - Generates template JSON configurations for animated backgrounds
  2. validate_animation_config.sh - Validates JSON format and checks for missing assets
  3. update_animation_paths.sh - Updates paths in configuration files when assets are reorganized
  All tools include comprehensive error handling, documentation, and user-friendly interfaces.

- DOCUMENTATION: Created detailed animation_system.md documentation covering JSON format, element types, and workflow.

- DOCUMENTATION: Updated animated_background_workflow.md to reference the new animation tools with examples.

## Next Steps
- Create test animated elements to verify the animation system works as expected
- Implement the cyan keying technique for window animations
- Add shader-based effects for enhanced visual elements

## Time Log
- Started: 08:30:00
- Ended: 10:45:00

## Summary
This session successfully completed two major tasks: fixing the camera system issues and implementing the animation configuration tools. We resolved the walkable area visualization problems, enhanced the camera scrolling behavior, and ensured the player always remains visible. Additionally, we created a comprehensive animation configuration system with tools for creating, validating, and updating animation configurations, all with detailed documentation. The animation system now provides a solid foundation for implementing the custom animations required for the game's distinctive visual style.
