# Development Session: Fix coordinate_transformation_test Timeout
**Date:** May 21, 2025
**Time:** 14:50:05
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Resolving timeout issues in coordinate_transformation_test unit test

## Session Goals
- Fix coordinate_transformation_test timeout issues to ensure all tests pass and run efficiently
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Add tests for NaN and infinity handling in CoordinateSystem class
- [x] Verify test passes after fixes
- [x] Optimize test performance by removing unnecessary yields
- [x] Fix identified issues causing the timeout
- [x] Apply similar timeout mechanisms used in coordinate_system_test
- [x] Analyze coordinate_transformation_test.gd for potential infinite loops or yield issues
- [x] Run coordinate_transformation_test to verify current timeout behavior
- [x] 

## Notes
- Found and fixed a bug in the CoordinateSystem static methods that wasn't handling NaN and infinity values properly. Added validation to world_view_to_game_view, game_view_to_world_view, apply_scale_factor, and remove_scale_factor methods to properly handle invalid coordinate values.
- Based on the logs and code analysis, coordinate_transformation_test.gd has issues similar to what we fixed in coordinate_system_test.gd: 1) Using runtime script compilation with district.get_script().source_code that fails silently 2) Dictionary key errors in test reporting 3) Excessive use of yield statements that slow down test execution 4) Missing timeout protection
