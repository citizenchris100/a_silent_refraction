- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Implement camera state enum and tracking variables
- [ ] Update iteration3_plan.md with user stories and implementation notes for all tasks
- [ ] Update iteration3_plan.md with comprehensive enhancement plan
- [ ] Analyze scrolling_camera.gd for coordinate conversion improvements
- [ ] Set up initial directory structure for multi-perspective system
- [ ] Create task breakdown and prioritization for multi-perspective character system
- [ ] Create task breakdown and prioritization for navigation refactoring
- [ ] Review and understand the Iteration 3 plan requirements

## Notes
- Camera System Template Development Plan: Create scene template from clean_camera_test to solve walkable area initialization issues.
- Found key issues with camera system test scene: 1) Walkable area not properly grouped, 2) Missing CollisionPolygon2D, 3) Background scaling not synchronized with camera bounds, 4) initial_camera_view not applied
- Task 1 Enhancement Plan: Scrolling Camera System

After analyzing the documentation and code, here is the enhancement plan for Task 1 that aligns with our architectural philosophy:

1. Coordinate Transformation Improvements:
- Enhance screen_to_world and world_to_screen methods to handle edge cases
- Add validation for NaN values during transformations
- Improve handling of edge cases near screen boundaries
- Enhance zoom-specific transformations for consistent behavior

2. Camera State Management Addition:
- Implement formal state system (IDLE, MOVING, FOLLOWING_PLAYER)
- Prevent conflicting camera movement commands
- Improve synchronization with player movement
- Implement clear entry/exit conditions for each state

3. Signal-Based Communication Enhancement:
- Add camera_move_started signal when camera begins movement
- Add camera_move_completed signal when movement finishes
- Add view_bounds_changed signal when boundaries update
- These support our established signal-based architecture

4. Coordinate Validation Methods:
- Add validate_coordinates method for viewport validation
- Implement is_point_in_view to check visibility
- Add ensure_valid_target for movement validation

5. Improve CoordinateManager Integration:
- Enhance integration with the singleton
- Add helper methods for direct utilization
- Ensure consistent coordinate handling
- Maintain proper separation of concerns

6. Comprehensive Testing Strategy:
- Create test cases for all conversion scenarios
- Implement visual debugging helpers
- Test at different zoom levels and positions
- Verify edge case handling

7. Documentation Updates:
- Update system documentation
- Document new methods, signals, and states
- Provide usage examples for proper implementation

This plan maintains our architectural principles of clear component boundaries, signal-based communication, state-driven behavior, and backward compatibility while improving the system.
- # Task 1 Enhancement Plan: Scrolling Camera System

After analyzing the documentation and code, I've identified the following enhancement plan for Task 1 (Enhance scrolling camera system with improved coordinate conversions). This plan aligns with the project's architectural philosophy and goals:

## 1. Coordinate Transformation Improvements
- Enhance  and  methods in ScrollingCamera to handle edge cases
- Add validation to detect and handle NaN values during transformations
- Improve handling of edge cases near screen boundaries
- Enhance zoom-specific transformations for consistent behavior at all zoom levels

## 2. Camera State Management Addition
- Implement formal state system with states such as:
  - IDLE: Camera is not moving
  - MOVING: Camera is transitioning between positions
  - FOLLOWING_PLAYER: Camera is actively tracking player movement
- This state tracking will prevent conflicting camera movement commands and improve synchronization
- Each state will have clear entry/exit conditions following state pattern principles

## 3. Signal-Based Communication Enhancement
- Add new signals to communicate camera state changes:
  - : Emitted when camera starts moving
  - : Emitted when camera finishes movement
  - : Emitted when camera boundaries change
- These signals support the project's established signal-based communication architecture

## 4. Coordinate Validation Methods
- Add validation methods to ensure coordinate integrity:
  - : Check if coordinates are valid in current viewport
  - : Check if a world point is currently visible
  - : Ensure a target position is valid for camera movement

## 5. Improve Integration with CoordinateManager
- Enhance integration with the CoordinateManager singleton
- Add helper methods to utilize the CoordinateManager directly
- Ensure consistent coordinate handling between camera and other systems
- Maintain proper separation of concerns following the project's component-based design

## 6. Testing Strategy
- Create test cases for each coordinate conversion scenario
- Implement visual debugging helpers for coordinate validation
- Test with different zoom levels and camera positions
- Test edge case handling to ensure stability

## 7. Documentation Updates
- Update camera system documentation to reflect enhancements
- Document new methods, signals, and state system
- Add usage examples for proper coordinate handling

## Architectural Alignment
This enhancement plan aligns with the project's architectural principles by:
- Maintaining clear component boundaries and single responsibility
- Using signal-based communication for loose coupling
- Enhancing state-driven behavior for predictability
- Building upon existing systems rather than rewriting them
- Improving testability and debugging capabilities
- Ensuring backward compatibility with existing scenes
- Task 1 Analysis: Enhancing the scrolling camera system requires focusing on several key improvements:

1. Coordinate Conversion Refinement: The screen_to_world and world_to_screen methods need enhancement to handle edge cases, especially at varying zoom levels. The existing code in scrolling_camera.gd has implementations that work in basic scenarios but may fail in specific conditions.

2. Camera Targeting Logic: The current _handle_camera_movement method needs refinement to eliminate edge case issues where the camera might jitter or fail to properly track the player.

3. State Management: Adding proper camera movement state tracking will prevent conflicting movements and provide better synchronization with player actions.

4. Signal-Based Communication: Implementing additional signals (camera_move_started, camera_move_completed, view_bounds_changed) to notify other systems of camera state changes aligns with our architectural approach.

5. Validation Methods: Adding methods to validate coordinates in different spaces will ensure consistent behavior across the system.

The implementation will build upon the existing camera system rather than replacing it, ensuring backward compatibility while addressing specific issues with coordinate handling.
