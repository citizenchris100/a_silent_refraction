# A Silent Refraction - Development Session Summary

This file provides an overview of all development sessions for the project.

## Sessions
### May 14, 2025 - Testing Claude Integration (ðŸŸ¢ IN PROGRESS)
- **Iteration:** 3.5
- **Focus:** Session Logger
- **Summary:** No summary provided
- [Session Log](session_2025-05-14_10-57-04.md)

### May 14, 2025 - Camera System and Animation Tools Implementation (âœ… COMPLETED)
- **Iteration:** 2
- **Focus:** Animation Configuration System
- **Summary:** This session successfully completed two major tasks: fixing the camera system issues and implementing the animation configuration tools. We resolved the walkable area visualization problems, enhanced the camera scrolling behavior, and ensured the player always remains visible. Additionally, we created a comprehensive animation configuration system with tools for creating, validating, and updating animation configurations, all with detailed documentation. The animation system now provides a solid foundation for implementing the custom animations required for the game's distinctive visual style.

### May 13, 2025 - Camera System Enhancements (âœ… COMPLETED)
- **Iteration:** 2
- **Focus:** Camera Effects and Optimizations
- **Summary:** This session focused on fixing issues with the camera system in our point-and-click adventure game. We made significant progress implementing multiple easing functions for smooth camera movement and fixing coordinate conversion issues. We also identified and fixed a bug with the PoolVector2Array.duplicate() method by implementing manual array copying.

### May 12, 2025 - Scrolling Camera System and Session Logger (âœ… COMPLETED)
- **Iteration:** 2
- **Focus:** Camera System and Development Tools
- **Summary:** Implemented scrolling camera system that follows player when they approach screen edges. The camera stays within defined bounds determined by the background size. Implemented logic to detect when player approaches screen edges and smoothly move the camera to follow them. Fixed issues with background positioning and camera bounds enforcement. Created comprehensive debug visualization for testing and refinement. Added camera configuration options to base_district.gd for flexible implementation in different areas. Created comprehensive session logging system to track development progress across multiple sessions, with features for task management, notes, and linking to specific code files.
