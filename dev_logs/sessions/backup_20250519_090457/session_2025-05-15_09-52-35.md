# Development Session: Final Validation Test
**Date:** May 15, 2025
**Time:** 09:52:35
**Iteration:** 2 - NPC Framework, Suspicion System, and Initial Asset Creation
**Task Focus:** Testing special character handling

## Session Goals
- Verify robust special character handling in session logger
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Implement scrolling camera system for wide backgrounds
- [ ] Design Shipping District main floor background with animated elements
- [ ] Create Docked Ship USCSS Theseus background (player starting location)
- [ ] Create Player character sprites (front, side, back views)
- [ ] Create assimilated variant of Player character sprites
- [ ] Create Security Officer sprites (standard, suspicious, hostile states)
- [ ] Create assimilated variants of Security Officer sprites
- [ ] Design NPC sprite template with state transitions
- [ ] Create Bank Teller sprites (initial quest NPC)
- [ ] Create assimilated variant of Bank Teller sprites
- [ ] Create Player's room (Room 306) background
- [ ] Perform in-game integration testing of all Iteration 2 features

## Progress Tracking
### Outstanding Tasks from Previous Session
- [ ] Test the debug system when creating walkable areas in different districts
- [ ] Complete the polygon visualizer integration with save/load functionality
- [ ] Fix any remaining issues with coordinate picker visibility
- [ ] Create documentation examples for using the debug system in different contexts
- [ ] Verify the debug_singleton.gd global integration
- [ ] Test the DebugManager implementation across multiple scenes

### New Tasks
- [x] Add fallback mechanisms for systems without Perl
- [x] Test summary updates with complex special characters
- [x] Implement special character handling for edit tools

## Notes
- Found that Perl provides the most robust handling of special characters in replacement operations.
- Implemented a three-tier approach for special character handling: Perl (primary), awk with null record separator (first fallback), simple awk (second fallback)
- Added a public command `update-summary` to allow manual regeneration of the summary file
- Fixed duplicate entries in the session summary file using an associative array for deduplication
- Updated the documentation to reflect the special character handling improvements

## Next Steps
- Consider adding additional special character handling approaches for other command outputs
- 

## Time Log
- Started: 09:52:35
- Ended: 12:10:22

## Summary
Completed comprehensive session logger improvements for handling special characters. Implemented a three-tier approach: Perl-based primary handler, awk fallbacks. Fixed summary duplication issues and added an update-summary command. All TODOs from the debug system have been preserved for future work.
