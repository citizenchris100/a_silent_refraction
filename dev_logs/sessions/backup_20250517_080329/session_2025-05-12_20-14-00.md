# Development Session: Scrolling Camera System and Session Logger
**Date:** May 12, 2025
**Time:** 20:14:00
**Iteration:** 2
**Task Focus:** Camera System and Development Tools

## Session Goals
- Implement scrolling camera system for wide backgrounds
- Create testing tools for camera functionality
- Develop session logging system

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Create scrolling_camera.gd script for camera logic
- [x] Update base_district.gd to support scrolling camera
- [x] Create test scene for camera functionality
- [x] Add debug visualization for camera bounds
- [x] Implement camera bounds enforcement
- [x] Create session logging system

## Notes
- Camera implementation needed to handle backgrounds larger than viewport
- Initial approach with Camera2D node required proper configuration to follow player
- Created dedicated scrolling_camera.gd script to extend Camera2D with edge-triggered scrolling
- Added configurable edge margins to control when camera starts following player
- Found issue with camera positioning when background is centered at (0,0)
- Fixed positioning by ensuring background is anchored at (0,0) rather than centered
- Implemented camera bounds to ensure camera stays within background area
- Used Rect2 for defining camera bounds based on background size
- Added debug visualization to display camera position, bounds, and margin areas
- Created debug overlay with camera statistics (position, bounds, follow status)
- Added configuration options in base_district.gd for camera settings:
  - camera_bounds: Rect2 defining the limits of camera movement
  - camera_follow_smoothing: Float value for smooth camera transitions
  - camera_edge_margin: Pixels from screen edge before camera starts following
- Modified district initialization to properly set up camera with player target
- Test scene created with a large background to demonstrate scrolling
- Fixed issue where camera would jitter at boundaries
- Implemented proper positioning of camera initially centering on background
- Added camera_half_size calculation to ensure bounds are calculated correctly
- Implementation successfully handles both small and large background areas
- Session logger created to track progress across multiple development sessions

## Next Steps
- Test camera with different background sizes
- Mark scrolling camera task as complete in iteration_progress.md
- Add smooth interpolation to camera movement
- Implement camera zoom functionality for different areas
- Add camera shake effect for special events
- Create configuration system for per-district camera settings

## Time Log
- Started: 20:14:00
- Ended: 20:25:00

## Summary
Implemented scrolling camera system that follows player when they approach screen edges. The camera stays within defined bounds determined by the background size. Implemented logic to detect when player approaches screen edges and smoothly move the camera to follow them. Fixed issues with background positioning and camera bounds enforcement. Created comprehensive debug visualization for testing and refinement. Added camera configuration options to base_district.gd for flexible implementation in different areas. Created comprehensive session logging system to track development progress across multiple sessions, with features for task management, notes, and linking to specific code files.
