# Development Session: Work on Iteration 2 Tasks
**Date:** May 17, 2025
**Time:** 08:03:29
**Iteration:** 2 - NPC Framework, Suspicion System, and Initial Asset Creation
**Task Focus:** Iteration Planning and NPC Registry System

## Session Goals
- Apply visual style guide to the Shipping District by updating the scene, implementing scrolling camera functionality, and ensuring proper implementation of the district's color palette and visual elements
- Create a user story for Task 7 (Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders)
- Test and verify the iteration planning system

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Apply visual style guide to Shipping District
- [~] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (added user story)
- [ ] Implement observation mechanics for detecting assimilated NPCs

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Apply the walkable area improvements to the Spaceport/Shipping district scene
- [ ] Test the scrolling camera functionality with the updated walkable area in test scene
- [ ] Implement proper walkable area for the scrolling camera test that extends across the full background width
- [x] Analyzed the iteration planner guide to understand the format and requirements for user stories
- [x] Created a comprehensive user story for Task 7 following the established format
- [x] Added detailed acceptance criteria and implementation notes for Task 7
- [x] Linked Task 7 to the appropriate implementation file (tools/create_npc_registry.sh)
- [x] Updated iteration plan with proper task details

## Notes
- Based on examining the clean_camera_test.gd script and comparing with shipping_district.gd, we need to make these changes: 1) Convert the TextureRect to a Sprite with centered=false for proper camera bounds calculation, 2) Enable scrolling camera with use_scrolling_camera=true, 3) Define a walkable area that spans the full width of the background, and 4) Test the camera view positions (left, center, right) to ensure proper scrolling behavior.
- Analyzed the clean_camera_test.gd example which successfully implements the scrolling camera system. Key components include: (1) Using a Sprite instead of TextureRect, (2) Setting use_scrolling_camera=true, (3) Creating an appropriate walkable area with proper coordinates for the full width of the background, (4) Properly handling camera view switching (left, center, right), and (5) Ensuring the background is wide enough to necessitate scrolling.
- Created a dedicated style_guide.md document in the docs directory extracted from the GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md. Also moved the GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md to the docs directory for better organization. The style guide contains color palettes, district-specific design notes, and implementation guidelines.
- Examined the existing create_npc_registry.sh script to understand its current functionality and what needs to be updated according to new requirements.
- Refined the user story for Task 7 to clarify that NPCs should be initialized in normal state (not assimilated) with normal suspicion levels, and that the script should create proper directory structures for the four different sprite states.
- Successfully tested the iteration planning system by adding a new user story and linking it to the implementation file.

## Next Steps
- Complete Task 6 for the Shipping District visual style guide implementation
- Implement updates to the create_npc_registry.sh script according to the user story requirements
- Begin planning for Task 8 (implementing observation mechanics)
