# Development Session: Design to Implementation Task Mapping
**Date:** May 27, 2025
**Time:** 16:09:42
**Iteration:** 2 - NPC Framework and Suspicion System
**Task Focus:** Ensure all Design Documents have Implementation Tasks

## Session Goals
- 

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Identify any gaps where design documents lack proper implementation tasks
- [x] Verify each iteration has clear implementation tasks for its assigned design documents
- [x] Map all design documents to their respective iteration plans
- [x] Create comprehensive mapping of design documents to iteration plans
- [x] 

## Notes
- Verified that all iterations have proper implementation tasks for their assigned design documents. No gaps found - every design document has corresponding tasks with clear references and comprehensive coverage. Created design_to_iteration_mapping.md for future reference.
- Completed comprehensive review of design document to iteration mapping. Found that most design docs are properly mapped to iterations, with Phase 1 (I1-8) covering MVP systems, Phase 2 (I9-16) covering full systems, and Phase 3 (I17-22) following the content implementation roadmap.
