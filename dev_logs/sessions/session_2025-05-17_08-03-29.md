**Iteration:** 2 - NPC Framework, Suspicion System, and Initial Asset Creation
**Task Focus:** Shipping District and Camera System

## Session Goals
- Apply visual style guide to the Shipping District by updating the scene, implementing scrolling camera functionality, and ensuring proper implementation of the district's color palette and visual elements

## Notes
- Analyzed the clean_camera_test.gd example which successfully implements the scrolling camera system. Key components include: (1) Using a Sprite instead of TextureRect, (2) Setting use_scrolling_camera=true, (3) Creating an appropriate walkable area with proper coordinates for the full width of the background, (4) Properly handling camera view switching (left, center, right), and (5) Ensuring the background is wide enough to necessitate scrolling.
- Created a dedicated style_guide.md document in the docs directory extracted from the GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md. Also moved the GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md to the docs directory for better organization. The style guide contains color palettes, district-specific design notes, and implementation guidelines.
