## Progress Tracking
- [x] Create failing test for smoothing bypass
- [ ] 

## Notes
- PRIORITY ORDER: 1) Fix the 2 failing scrolling_camera_test tests first. 2) Then fix the click offset bug where input_manager.gd line 49 uses event.position (screen coords) instead of get_global_mouse_position() (world coords). User is being disciplined about fixing tests before adding new features.
- TEST STATUS: Running all unit tests shows 181/183 tests passing. Only 2 tests are failing, both in scrolling_camera_test: 1) 'Camera uses physics process for player tracking' and 2) 'Camera instant positioning with high smoothing value'. These failures are likely from our camera changes during screen tearing investigation. All other test suites (12 out of 13) are passing completely.
- NEW ISSUE DISCOVERED: Click position offset bug. Video shows player moving to wrong position when clicked. ANALYSIS: The input_manager.gd is using event.position (screen coordinates) instead of get_global_mouse_position() (world coordinates) on line 49. This causes the player to move to an offset position. The fix is simple but we must address failing tests first.
- IMPORTANT: User identified that we have failing tests from previous camera work that need to be fixed BEFORE addressing new issues. Specifically, the scrolling_camera_test has 2 failing tests: 'Camera uses physics process for player tracking' and 'Camera instant positioning with high smoothing value'. These tests are failing because we moved ensure_pixel_perfect() to _physics_process but didn't update the tests.
- PERMANENT FIX IMPLEMENTED: Added 'asr' alias to ~/.bashrc that automatically applies software rendering fix. User can now run 'asr camera-system' from anywhere and it will work without screen tearing. This persists across reboots.
- SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Created dev_run.sh that uses software rendering (LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1) to bypass Intel graphics screen tearing issue during development. This is appropriate since the target hardware (Raspberry Pi 5) uses completely different GPU architecture. The game will ship on controlled hardware where this issue won't exist.
- Reviewing game requirements: SCUMM-style adventure game requires smooth camera following. Instant camera movement would be jarring and wrong for the genre. Need to find a solution that provides smooth camera movement WITHOUT screen tearing in Godot 3.5.2.
- FINAL VIDEO EVIDENCE: Mode 1 (instant) = NO tearing. Modes 2-4 (all interpolation methods) = tearing present. This confirms that camera interpolation in Godot 3.5.2 has a fundamental timing issue that causes mid-frame position updates, resulting in horizontal tearing regardless of the interpolation method used.
- PHYSICS TEST RESULTS: Mode 1 (process) has noticeable tearing. Mode 2 (physics_process) is worse. Mode 3 (manual physics interpolation) is worst. This confirms that camera interpolation timing relative to frame rendering is the core issue. The tear 'lags more' in higher modes because the update is increasingly decoupled from the render timing.
- VIDEO ANALYSIS: User's video shows expected camera smoothing behavior (camera catching up to teleported player), but also reveals the frame timing issue. The horizontal tearing line is consistent and appears to be where the camera position changes mid-frame during rendering. This is a known issue with interpolated movement in some rendering pipelines.
- USER OBSERVATION: 1) Higher smoothing values make camera move FASTER (not smoother/slower as expected). 2) Screen tearing amount is CONSTANT from 0.5 to 20 - only camera speed changes. This suggests smoothing_speed in Camera2D is actually a 'follow speed' multiplier, not a smoothing factor. The tearing is likely caused by ANY asynchronous camera update, regardless of speed.
- CRITICAL: Screen tearing begins at the MINIMUM smoothing value of 0.5. This indicates that ANY camera interpolation causes the issue. The problem appears to be a fundamental timing mismatch between when the camera position is interpolated and when the frame is rendered, causing a mid-frame update that results in tearing.
- Created smoothing threshold test. Initial run with smoothing=0 shows NO tearing. User needs to press UP arrow to increase smoothing value incrementally (0.5 steps) to find the exact threshold where tearing begins. This will help determine if there's a specific smoothing range that causes the issue.
- BREAKTHROUGH: Screen tearing ONLY occurs when camera smoothing is enabled! With smoothing disabled, there is NO tearing. This confirms the issue is related to camera interpolation/smoothing creating a desync between camera position updates and frame rendering.
- CRITICAL FINDING: Screen tearing occurs in the SAME location with both custom ScrollingCamera AND basic Camera2D! This proves the issue is NOT in our camera code but likely in: 1) Godot's rendering pipeline, 2) Graphics driver/OS compositor, or 3) Project rendering settings
- CRITICAL DISCOVERY: Found malformed VSync settings in project.godot! Lines 142 and 144 had comments merged with the settings, preventing VSync and pixel_snap from being properly enabled. Fixed by separating the comments from the settings. This could be the root cause of screen tearing!
- SUMMARY OF ATTEMPTS - Previous session: Synchronized camera/player to _physics_process. Result: Screen tearing persists. Replaced ColorRect with Sprite. Result: Still tearing. Moved ensure_pixel_perfect to physics_process. Result: Still tearing. Added smoothing bypass for values over 1000. Result: Not triggered due to overrides. Current: All attempts failed to fix screen tearing.
- Screen tearing STILL PRESENT after sprite fix and pixel-perfect timing fix. Need to investigate camera smoothing/easing as the likely culprit.
- ROOT CAUSE FOUND: 1) Player uses ColorRect instead of Sprite - different rendering pipeline. 2) Camera calls ensure_pixel_perfect() in _process() but moves in _physics_process() - timing mismatch. 3) ColorRect doesn't have same pixel-perfect options as Sprite nodes.
- Video analysis: Screen tearing appears as horizontal line during movement. User mentions player character is a POLYGON, not a sprite - this could be significant as polygon rendering may behave differently than sprite rendering in Godot's pipeline.
- Based on previous session analysis: Screen tearing persists despite synchronizing camera and player to _physics_process(). Root causes identified include: 1) Camera smoothing/easing mismatch with player movement, 2) Pixel-perfect positioning called in _process() while movement in _physics_process(), 3) Multiple position rounding at different stages. Need to investigate camera smoothing parameters and pixel-perfect timing.
- 

## Next Steps
- DEEP METHODICAL ANALYSIS NEEDED: 1) Verify VSync is actually working in Godot. 2) Check if issue is in Godot's Camera2D base class vs our custom code. 3) Test with built-in Camera2D smoothing disabled. 4) Investigate render order and frame timing. 5) Test with different Godot rendering settings.
