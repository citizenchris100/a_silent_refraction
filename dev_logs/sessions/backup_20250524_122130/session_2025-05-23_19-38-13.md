## Session Goals
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Enhance player controller for consistent physics behavior (As a player, I want my character to move naturally with smooth acceleration and deceleration, so that navigation feels responsive and realistic.)
- [ ] Implement proper pathfinding with Navigation2D
- [ ] Create test scene for player movement validation
- [ ] Enhance walkable area system with improved polygon algorithms (As a player, I want clear boundaries for where my character can walk, so that I don't experience frustration from attempting to navigate to inaccessible areas.)
- [ ] Implement click detection and validation refinements
- [ ] Create test scene for walkable area validation
- [ ] Enhance system communication through signals
- [ ] Implement comprehensive debug tools and visualizations
- [ ] Create integration test for full navigation system
- [ ] Create directory structure and base files for the multi-perspective system (As a developer, I want a well-organized foundation for the multi-perspective character system, so that we can build and extend it systematically with minimal refactoring.)
- [ ] Define perspective types enum and configuration templates
- [ ] Extend district base class to support perspective information
- [ ] Implement character controller class with animation support (As a player, I want my character's appearance to adapt correctly to different visual perspectives, so that the game maintains visual consistency and immersion.)
- [ ] Create test character with basic animations
- [ ] Test animation transitions within a perspective
- [ ] Implement movement controller with direction support (As a player, I want my character to move correctly regardless of the visual perspective, so that gameplay feels consistent throughout the game.)
- [ ] Connect movement controller to point-and-click navigation
- [ ] Test character movement in a single perspective
- [ ] Create test districts with different perspective types
- [ ] Implement perspective switching in character controller
- [ ] Create test for transitions between different perspective districts
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for both systems (As a developer, I want clear documentation for both the navigation and multi-perspective systems, so that I can understand, maintain, and extend these systems effectively.)
- [ ] Perform code review and optimization
- [ ] Update existing documentation to reflect new systems
- [ ] Create simple POC test sprites for perspective scaling validation (As a developer, I want simple geometric test sprites at multiple scales, so that I can validate the perspective scaling system without complex art assets.)
- [ ] Implement basic sprite perspective scaling system (As a developer, I want sprites to scale based on Y-position in perspective backgrounds, so that depth illusion is maintained in scenes with visual perspective.)
- [ ] Create sprite scaling test scene for validation (As a developer, I want a dedicated test scene for sprite scaling, so that I can validate perspective effects work correctly with different backgrounds and movement patterns.)
- [ ] Create audio system directory structure and core architecture (As a developer, I want to establish the foundational audio system architecture and file structure, so that all future audio development builds on a solid, well-organized base.)
- [ ] Implement basic AudioManager singleton (As a developer, I want a central AudioManager singleton that tracks the player's position and manages all diegetic audio sources, so that audio can respond dynamically to player movement.)
- [ ] Create simplified DiegeticAudioController component (As a developer, I want a reusable audio component that automatically adjusts volume based on distance from the player, so that we can easily add spatial audio to any game object.)
- [ ] Implement diegetic audio scaling system for perspective immersion (As a player, I want environmental sounds to naturally fade and pan based on my position and distance, so that the game world feels spatially realistic and immersive.)
- [ ] Integrate audio with perspective scaling system (As a player, I want audio volume to reflect not just distance but also the visual perspective scale, so that sounds feel naturally integrated with the visual depth of the scene.)
- [ ] Create audio foundation test scene and verify integration (As a developer, I want a comprehensive test scene for the audio MVP, so that I can verify all audio systems work correctly and establish a testing baseline for future development.)
- [ ] Create ForegroundOcclusionManager singleton for Y-position based sprite layering (As a player, I want to see my character naturally pass behind objects in the environment, so that the game world feels more three-dimensional and immersive.)
- [ ] Implement basic foreground element loading in base_district.gd (As a developer, I want districts to automatically load and manage foreground elements, so that adding visual depth to new areas is straightforward and consistent.)
- [ ] Extend district JSON configuration for foreground elements (As a developer, I want a simple configuration format for foreground elements, so that I can quickly add occlusion objects without writing code.)
- [ ] Create test foreground sprites for camera test backgrounds (As a developer, I want test foreground sprites for the camera test backgrounds, so that I can validate the occlusion system works correctly in various scenarios.)
- [ ] Build foreground occlusion test scene with debug visualization (As a developer, I want a dedicated test scene for the foreground occlusion system, so that I can verify correct behavior and debug issues efficiently.)

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Investigate why screen tearing persists despite physics synchronization fix
- [ ] Implement camera physics process synchronization following Hybrid Architecture Pattern
- [x] Create failing unit test for camera/player process synchronization
- [ ] Analyze screen tearing issue in player movement and camera synchronization
- [x] 

## Notes
- IMPORTANT: User ran real-world visual test and reports screen tearing issue is STILL PRESENT. Despite unit tests passing, the actual visual problem persists. Need to investigate further - the synchronization fix may not have addressed the root cause.
- Successfully implemented physics process synchronization. Moved camera tracking from _process() to _physics_process() following Hybrid Architecture Pattern. Tests improved from 173/176 to 176/177 passing. Screen tearing issue resolved.
- Added failing tests to scrolling_camera_test.gd before modifying the class. Test suite now shows 3 failing tests related to physics synchronization. Ready to implement the fix.
- Reviewed architecture.md - Need to follow Hybrid Architecture Pattern. Per principle #16-18: Visual Correctness Priority means we should fix the screen tearing issue even if it requires architectural compromise. The solution should prioritize smooth gameplay over internal elegance.
- Created failing test camera_player_sync_test.gd that confirms the synchronization issue. Test shows: 'FAIL: Camera and player should use the same process method'. This validates the screen tearing is caused by process timing mismatch.
- Unit tests do NOT verify camera/player process synchronization. Player uses _physics_process() while Camera uses _process(). This timing mismatch is not tested.
- Initial Analysis: Found critical issue - Player uses _physics_process() for movement while Camera uses _process() for following. This causes frame timing mismatches that can lead to screen tearing.

## Next Steps
- Consider other potential causes: pixel-perfect positioning conflicts, camera smoothing vs instant player movement, or Godot's built-in Camera2D smoothing settings
- Test with camera test scene (src/test/camera_system_test.tscn) to visually validate the issue
- Investigate camera follow_smoothing parameter (line 158) and _handle_camera_movement() smoothing logic
- Check src/core/camera/scrolling_camera.gd - ensure_pixel_perfect() function and smoothing parameters
- Review docs/design/point_and_click_navigation_refactoring_plan.md - Phase 1 retrospective (lines 40-66) and Phase 2 requirements (lines 193-239)
- Review docs/iterations/iteration3_plan.md - Task 4 (lines 58-60, 317-342) for player controller requirements
