# Session Log: May 15, 2025 - Walkable Area Visualization Issues

## Problem Statement

We encountered an issue with walkable area visualization in our debug system. When testing the camera with a manually selected walkable area, two different walkable area visualizations were appearing simultaneously:

1. The large green square (covering most of the scene) that seems to come from a debug visualization system
2. The specific walkable area we manually defined at the bottom of the screen

This created confusion and made it difficult to work with the designated walkable areas we're creating for each scene.

## Root Cause Analysis

After examining the codebase, we've identified the following root causes:

1. The current debug system's `polygon_visualizer.gd` is using a global approach to find walkable areas:
   ```gdscript
   var nodes = get_tree().get_nodes_in_group(target_group)
   ```

2. This retrieves ALL nodes in the "walkable_area" group from the entire scene tree, including:
   - Walkable areas in our current scene
   - Walkable areas in other scenes that might be loaded
   - Walkable areas in debug overlays and tools

3. Multiple scene elements are adding walkable areas:
   - Our primary scene (`new_camera_test.gd`) adds the specific walkable area we defined
   - The debug visualization system adds its own walkable areas for testing
   - The `scrolling_camera_test.gd` might be adding walkable areas as well

4. The approach lacks scene-level context, treating all walkable areas equally regardless of their source scene.

## Proposed Solution: Scene-Specific Walkable Area Visualization

We've decided to implement a comprehensive architectural change to the debug system that limits walkable area visualization to only show areas from the current active scene. This provides a universal solution that will work with any scene.

### Solution Components:

1. **Scene-Scoped Polygon Finding**: Modify the `find_polygons()` method in `polygon_visualizer.gd` to only find walkable areas within the current scene hierarchy.

2. **Recursive Traversal**: Implement a helper method to recursively find polygons starting from the current scene node, rather than searching the entire global scene tree.

3. **Origin Awareness**: Add logging and tracking to better understand which scene each walkable area comes from.

4. **Visualization Controls**: Potentially add UI controls to toggle between showing only scene-specific walkable areas and all walkable areas.

### Implementation Plan:

```gdscript
func find_polygons():
    polygons = []
    
    // Only process polygons from the current active scene
    var current_scene = get_tree().get_current_scene()
    if current_scene:
        // Find polygons only within the current scene and its children
        find_polygons_in_node(current_scene)
        
        // Print a summary of what we found
        print("Found " + str(polygons.size()) + " polygons from the current scene: " + current_scene.name)
    else:
        // Fallback to old behavior if we can't determine current scene
        print("WARNING: Could not determine current scene, falling back to global polygon search")
        var nodes = get_tree().get_nodes_in_group(target_group)
        for node in nodes:
            if node is Polygon2D and node.has_method("get_polygon"):
                polygons.append(node)
                print("Found polygon: " + node.name)

// Helper method to recursively find polygons starting from a specific node
func find_polygons_in_node(node):
    // Check if this node is a polygon in our target group
    if node is Polygon2D and node.has_method("get_polygon") and node.is_in_group(target_group):
        polygons.append(node)
        print("Found polygon in current scene: " + node.name + " at path: " + node.get_path_to(node))
    
    // Recursively check all children
    for child in node.get_children():
        find_polygons_in_node(child)
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Universal Solution**: This change will apply to any scene, not just our camera test scene.

2. **Clean Visualization**: Users will only see the walkable areas relevant to their current work.

3. **Debugging Clarity**: Easier to understand which walkable areas belong to the current scene.

4. **Scalability**: As the project grows with more scenes and walkable areas, the visualization remains manageable.

5. **Better Architectural Design**: Respects scene boundaries and follows the principle of least surprise.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the scene-specific walkable area visualization in `polygon_visualizer.gd`.
2. Test across multiple scenes to ensure it works universally.
3. Consider adding a toggle option for developers who might want to see all walkable areas.
4. Update documentation to reflect this architectural change.

This solution follows our project's architectural principles by maintaining proper separation of concerns and ensuring that debug visualizations don't interfere with actual game development work.
