## Notes
- Completed comprehensive analysis of GDD vs existing design docs. Identified critical missing systems: Suspicion System, Assimilation System, Economy System, Inventory System, Save System (single slot), Coalition/Resistance System, Detection/Game Over System, Puzzle System, Day/Night Cycle, Multiple Endings System. Also identified essential systems previously marked as minor: Tram transportation, Disguise/clothing mechanics, Crime events in Mall, District access control, Interactive audio sources, NPC trust/relationship tracking. All of these require design documents before implementation.
- Created all 5 template design documents: Template NPC, Template District, Template Dialog, Template Interactive Object, and Template Quest. Removed old quest_design.md that didn't align with template approach.
- Created formal phased development approach document at docs/reference/phased_development_approach.md that defines three phases: MVP Systems, Full Systems, and Full Content Implementation
- Building narrative content on incomplete systems may require significant rework when systems are finalized
- Consider moving narrative content tasks like quests and investigation mechanics to after full systems implementation
- Early iterations focus on MVP implementations while later iterations expand to full system versions
- No tasks for creating NPC sprites for characters like Dock Workers Security Officers Doctors Bank Tellers Patrons etc
- Missing districts include Mall Medical Security Trading Floor Barracks and Engineering
- GDD lists approximately 150 NPCs across 7 districts but current tasks only create Shipping District and one additional district
- Major gap identified in iteration planning - no specific tasks for creating the 7 districts defined in GDD
- 

## Next Steps
- Propose restructuring iterations to complete all technical systems before narrative content development
- Create comprehensive list of all districts and NPCs that need implementation based on GDD
- Determine whether to create dedicated iteration for District and NPC Implementation or distribute tasks across existing iterations
-
