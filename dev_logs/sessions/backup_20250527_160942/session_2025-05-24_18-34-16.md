# Development Session: Fix Failing Unit Tests and Movement Offset Bug
**Date:** May 24, 2025
**Time:** 18:34:16
**Iteration:** 3 - Navigation Refactoring and Multi-Perspective Character System
**Task Focus:** Fix 2 failing scrolling_camera_test tests then address click position offset issue

## Session Goals
- Fix the movement offset bug where clicks use screen coordinates instead of world coordinates
- Fix the 2 failing scrolling_camera_test tests that broke during screen tearing investigation
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Enhance player controller for consistent physics behavior (As a player, I want my character to move naturally with smooth acceleration and deceleration, so that navigation feels responsive and realistic.)
- [ ] Implement proper pathfinding with Navigation2D
- [ ] Create test scene for player movement validation
- [ ] Enhance walkable area system with improved polygon algorithms (As a player, I want clear boundaries for where my character can walk, so that I don't experience frustration from attempting to navigate to inaccessible areas.)
- [ ] Implement click detection and validation refinements
- [ ] Create test scene for walkable area validation
- [ ] Enhance system communication through signals
- [ ] Implement comprehensive debug tools and visualizations
- [ ] Create integration test for full navigation system
- [ ] Create directory structure and base files for the multi-perspective system (As a developer, I want a well-organized foundation for the multi-perspective character system, so that we can build and extend it systematically with minimal refactoring.)
- [ ] Define perspective types enum and configuration templates
- [ ] Extend district base class to support perspective information
- [ ] Implement character controller class with animation support (As a player, I want my character's appearance to adapt correctly to different visual perspectives, so that the game maintains visual consistency and immersion.)
- [ ] Create test character with basic animations
- [ ] Test animation transitions within a perspective
- [ ] Implement movement controller with direction support (As a player, I want my character to move correctly regardless of the visual perspective, so that gameplay feels consistent throughout the game.)
- [ ] Connect movement controller to point-and-click navigation
- [ ] Test character movement in a single perspective
- [ ] Create test districts with different perspective types
- [ ] Implement perspective switching in character controller
- [ ] Create test for transitions between different perspective districts
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for both systems (As a developer, I want clear documentation for both the navigation and multi-perspective systems, so that I can understand, maintain, and extend these systems effectively.)
- [ ] Perform code review and optimization
- [ ] Update existing documentation to reflect new systems
- [ ] Create simple POC test sprites for perspective scaling validation (As a developer, I want simple geometric test sprites at multiple scales, so that I can validate the perspective scaling system without complex art assets.)
- [ ] Implement basic sprite perspective scaling system (As a developer, I want sprites to scale based on Y-position in perspective backgrounds, so that depth illusion is maintained in scenes with visual perspective.)
- [ ] Create sprite scaling test scene for validation (As a developer, I want a dedicated test scene for sprite scaling, so that I can validate perspective effects work correctly with different backgrounds and movement patterns.)
- [ ] Create audio system directory structure and core architecture (As a developer, I want to establish the foundational audio system architecture and file structure, so that all future audio development builds on a solid, well-organized base.)
- [ ] Implement basic AudioManager singleton (As a developer, I want a central AudioManager singleton that tracks the player's position and manages all diegetic audio sources, so that audio can respond dynamically to player movement.)
- [ ] Create simplified DiegeticAudioController component (As a developer, I want a reusable audio component that automatically adjusts volume based on distance from the player, so that we can easily add spatial audio to any game object.)
- [ ] Implement diegetic audio scaling system for perspective immersion (As a player, I want environmental sounds to naturally fade and pan based on my position and distance, so that the game world feels spatially realistic and immersive.)
- [ ] Integrate audio with perspective scaling system (As a player, I want audio volume to reflect not just distance but also the visual perspective scale, so that sounds feel naturally integrated with the visual depth of the scene.)
- [ ] Create audio foundation test scene and verify integration (As a developer, I want a comprehensive test scene for the audio MVP, so that I can verify all audio systems work correctly and establish a testing baseline for future development.)
- [ ] Create ForegroundOcclusionManager singleton for Y-position based sprite layering (As a player, I want to see my character naturally pass behind objects in the environment, so that the game world feels more three-dimensional and immersive.)
- [ ] Implement basic foreground element loading in base_district.gd (As a developer, I want districts to automatically load and manage foreground elements, so that adding visual depth to new areas is straightforward and consistent.)
- [ ] Extend district JSON configuration for foreground elements (As a developer, I want a simple configuration format for foreground elements, so that I can quickly add occlusion objects without writing code.)
- [ ] Create test foreground sprites for camera test backgrounds (As a developer, I want test foreground sprites for the camera test backgrounds, so that I can validate the occlusion system works correctly in various scenarios.)
- [ ] Build foreground occlusion test scene with debug visualization (As a developer, I want a dedicated test scene for the foreground occlusion system, so that I can verify correct behavior and debug issues efficiently.)

## Notes
- Updated unit_testing_guide.md to document when tests should extend base_district vs Node2D. Tests involving camera systems, coordinate conversion, or player input should use the district architecture for proper integration.
- TEST STATUS: Successfully created a failing test that demonstrates the coordinate conversion bug. The test shows player moves to screen coordinates (100,100) instead of world coordinates (600,400). The player_controller.gd was modified to attempt coordinate conversion, but the fallback calculation is too simplistic.
- User mentioned that docs/reference/development_environment_setup.md was implemented in the last session. This explains the 'asr' alias and software rendering approach to simulate Raspberry Pi 5 target hardware during development.
- Successfully removed irrelevant tests from scrolling_camera_test.gd. The tests were checking for Camera2D base class properties (follow_smoothing, edge_margin) that don't exist in our custom ScrollingCamera and aren't needed for a SCUMM-style adventure game. All 181 unit tests now pass.
- DEEP ANALYSIS: The two failing tests ('Camera uses physics process for player tracking' and 'Camera instant positioning with high smoothing value') are testing Camera2D base class properties (follow_smoothing, edge_margin) that don't exist in our ScrollingCamera implementation. These tests are NOT relevant to the game's actual needs.
- 

## Next Steps
- Consider whether player_controller.gd should handle coordinate conversion at all, or if this responsibility belongs elsewhere (e.g., in the camera system or a dedicated coordinate manager). The current approach mixes input handling with coordinate transformation concerns.
- Fix coordinate conversion properly: The current fallback calculation (event.position + camera.global_position - get_viewport().size / 2) is too simplistic. Need to either: 1) Ensure ScrollingCamera's screen_to_world method is available in camera-system test, or 2) Implement proper coordinate transformation that accounts for camera zoom and viewport scaling.
