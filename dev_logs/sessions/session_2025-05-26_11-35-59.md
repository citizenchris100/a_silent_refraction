## Notes
- Implementation Approach for Trading Floor - Will update job_work_quest_system_design.md to add trading floor job with standard job mechanics. Will create new trading_floor_minigame_system_design.md for the Tetris-clone specifics. Gender barriers: Women need higher trust/credentials to get hired, face harassment during shifts, and may experience condescending behavior about their 'ability to handle numbers'. Pay formula: credits = (score * conversion_rate) if score >= minimum_threshold else 0.
- Trading Floor Mini-game Details - Leaderboard shows generated NPC trader names/scores (not tied to actual story NPCs). Game Boy aesthetic using KISS principle (simple implementation). NO other mini-games planned. Mini-game is Tetris-style block game with monochrome pea-green Game Boy visuals. Entry quest more difficult for women following existing gender bias systems. UI flow: Main Screen (with leaderboard) -> Play Game -> Game Screen -> Exit to Main Screen.
- Trading Floor Job Design Discussion - Takes place in Financial District (no new districts). Mini-game consumes in-game time at standard rate. Players can play unlimited rounds per shift. Cannot be interrupted mid-game. Linear score-to-credits conversion with configurable minimum score threshold. Poor performance affects job reputation if existing systems support it, otherwise skip. Leaderboard not affected by story progression - uses KISS principle.
- Completed npc_trust_relationship_system_design.md update with comprehensive gender-based trust modifiers. Added: gender-aware personality trait modifiers affecting trust gain/loss rates, gender-specific trust actions (both positive and negative), gender-profession barriers with progressiveness scaling, romance system gender compatibility checks, and gender-aware UI displays. All integrated with modular serialization.
- Completed job_work_quest_system_design.md update with comprehensive gender-based difficulty modifiers. Added: job-specific gender modifiers (10-25% difficulty changes), harassment event system, gender-specific job requirements, coworker gender dynamics, and serialization of gender statistics. Integrated with NPC personality traits, dialog system, and trust system.
- Completed template_npc_design.md update with gender-aware personality traits. Integrated with: modular serialization (delta compression for traits), dialog system refactoring (extended DialogContext), and existing BaseNPC architecture. Gender traits include progressiveness, sexism_level, competitiveness, and gender_comfort.
- Correction: template_npc_design.md was created but does not yet include gender-aware personality traits. This task is still pending.
- Gender dynamics can be implemented using existing systems: Dialog system already supports contextual generation, Trust system has personality modifiers, Job system has performance evaluation. Need minimal extensions: add gender to DialogContext, create gender-aware dialog templates, extend trust barriers for gender combinations, add gender-based job difficulty modifiers, and add personality traits like progressiveness/sexist/competitiveness.
