# Session Log: May 15, 2025 - Debugging System Overhaul

## Problem Resolution Summary

We successfully solved two major issues with our debug visualization system:

1. **Walkable Area Visualization Issue**: We identified that the polygon_visualizer.gd was showing walkable areas from all scenes, not just the current one. This was fixed by modifying the `find_polygons()` method to only search within the current scene hierarchy.

2. **Big Green Box Problem**: We discovered the source of the persistent "big green box" that was appearing in camera test scenes. It was caused by the scrolling_camera.gd's debug visualization, which draws a green rectangle to show camera margins. We fixed this by:
   - Setting `debug_draw = false` as the default in scrolling_camera.gd
   - Adding an override in camera test scenes to explicitly disable debug drawing

## Debug System Architecture Analysis

We performed a comprehensive analysis of the entire debug system, which revealed:

1. **Main Components**:
   - `debug_singleton.gd`: Global debug manager that handles keyboard shortcuts and tool creation
   - `debug_manager.gd`: Scene-specific debug manager that creates and controls debug tools
   - Various debug tools like coordinate_picker.gd and polygon_visualizer.gd

2. **Deprecated Components**:
   - `debug_overlay.gd`: Deprecated in favor of debug_manager.gd 
   - `debug_tools.gd`: Deprecated older version of debug functionality

3. **Key Issues**:
   - Camera debug drawing was enabled by default
   - Polygon visualizer was finding walkable areas globally instead of scene-specifically
   - Too many duplicate/deprecated debug components causing confusion

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Deprecated Files**:
   - Removed debug_tools.gd and debug_overlay.gd, which were marked as deprecated

2. **Fixed Walkable Area Visualization**:
   - Updated polygon_visualizer.gd to use get_tree().get_current_scene() and only search within that scene

3. **Fixed Camera Debug Visualization**:
   - Changed scrolling_camera.gd to have debug_draw disabled by default
   - Modified camera test scenes to explicitly disable debug drawing
   - Created a clean camera test scene as a template for future tests

4. **Simplified Coordinate Picker**:
   - Consolidated coordinate picker implementations (removing coordinate_picker_fixed.gd)

## Architectural Improvements

1. **Scene-Specific Visualization**: Debug tools now correctly respect scene boundaries, preventing confusion when multiple scenes have similar elements.

2. **Default-Off Debug Drawing**: Camera debug visualization is now off by default, with an explicit opt-in required.

3. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed deprecated and duplicate files to reduce maintenance burden and confusion.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Documentation Updates**: The debug system documentation should be updated to reflect these changes.

2. **Test All Scenes**: Verify that these changes work correctly across all scenes, not just the camera test scene.

3. **Consider Camera Debug Toggle**: Add an easy way for developers to toggle camera debug visualization when needed.

## Conclusion

The debug system now provides a cleaner, more predictable experience for developers. The scene-specific approach to walkable area visualization ensures that developers only see what's relevant to their current work, and the removal of automatic camera debug drawing eliminates visual clutter.

## Outstanding TODOs for Future Sessions

While the critical issues have been resolved, the following improvements would further refine the debug system:

1. **Simple Coordinate Picker Evaluation**: Evaluate if `simple_coordinate_picker.gd` is still needed alongside `coordinate_picker.gd` or if they should be merged.

2. **Debug Loader Cleanup**: Update `debug_loader.gd` to remove references to the now-deleted `debug_overlay.gd` and use the current architecture.

3. **Debug Singleton Documentation**: Add clear architecture comments to `debug_singleton.gd` explaining the overall system and component interactions.

4. **Debug Command System**: Implement a more structured debug command system for runtime toggling of debug features like camera visualization.

5. **Consistent Debug Groups**: Establish standardized naming conventions for debug-related node groups (e.g., "debug_walkable_area" vs "designer_walkable_area") with documentation.
