# Development Session: Coordinate System Bounds Calculation Fix
**Date:** May 20, 2025
**Time:** 14:42:49
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Resolving min/max bounds calculation issue in DefaultBoundsValidator

## Session Goals
- Fix bounds calculation in DefaultBoundsValidator when camera size exceeds bounds
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Check for any other tests that might be affected by the change
- [ ] Test and verify the fix with coordinate_conversion_test
- [ ] Modify DefaultBoundsValidator to handle min > max edge cases
- [ ] Analyze coordinate_conversion_test failures related to bounds calculation
- [ ] 

## Notes
- Important consideration: As a SCUMM-style point-and-click adventure game, camera control is entirely handled by the game system based on room/scene design, not by player input. This means that when a scene is smaller than the viewport, centering the camera is a logical approach that aligns with the game design pattern.
- Proposed Solution 2: Fix the test by explicitly setting a zoom level that ensures the camera viewport is smaller than the test bounds. This addresses the root cause by preventing the invalid configuration, but it would require changing test expectations. This is a more architecturally correct solution but requires more test changes.
- Proposed Solution 1: Modify DefaultBoundsValidator to detect and handle the min > max case by using the center of the available space. This would prevent the clamp() function from receiving invalid arguments, but it's treating a symptom rather than the root cause. This approach maintains backward compatibility with existing tests.
- Root cause identified: The camera viewport size (1424x952) is being used with a zoom level of 1.0, resulting in a camera half-size of (712, 476). When the test sets bounds to (0, 0, 1000, 1000), the camera width (1424) is larger than the bounds width (1000), making it impossible to keep the camera fully within bounds. This causes min_x (712) to be greater than max_x (288), which breaks the clamp() function logic.
- Conducting a root cause analysis of the min > max issue in bounds validation.
- The coordinate_conversion_test.gd expects that a position within the bounds (e.g., 500, 500 in a 1000x1000 area) should remain unchanged, but the DefaultBoundsValidator is adjusting it due to the camera half-size (712, 476). This causes min_x to be 712, so any x coordinate less than 712 gets adjusted upward, causing the test to fail.
