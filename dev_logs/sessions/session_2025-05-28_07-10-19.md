## Session Goals
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Enhance walkable area system with improved polygon algorithms (As a player, I want clear boundaries for where my character can walk, so that I don't experience frustration from attempting to navigate to inaccessible areas.)
- [ ] Implement click detection and validation refinements (As a player, I want accurate click detection for character movement and object interaction, so that the game correctly interprets my intentions even in visually complex scenes.)
- [ ] Create test scene for walkable area validation (As a developer, I want a test scene for walkable areas, so that I can verify polygon algorithms, boundary detection, and multi-area functionality work correctly.)
- [ ] Enhance system communication through signals (As a developer, I want robust signal-based communication between navigation systems, so that components remain decoupled while still coordinating their behavior effectively.)
- [ ] Implement comprehensive debug tools and visualizations (As a developer, I want robust debug tools for the navigation system, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues during development.)
- [ ] Create integration test for full navigation system (As a developer, I want comprehensive integration tests for the navigation system, so that I can verify all components work together correctly and prevent regressions.)
- [ ] Create directory structure and base files for the multi-perspective system (As a developer, I want a well-organized foundation for the multi-perspective character system, so that we can build and extend it systematically with minimal refactoring.)
- [ ] Define perspective types enum and configuration templates (As a developer, I want a clear definition of perspective types with configuration templates, so that I can easily create and maintain consistent visual perspectives across the game.)
- [ ] Extend district base class to support perspective information (As a developer, I want the district system to include perspective information, so that districts can properly communicate their visual style to character controllers.)
- [ ] Implement character controller class with animation support (As a player, I want my character's appearance to adapt correctly to different visual perspectives, so that the game maintains visual consistency and immersion.)
- [ ] Create test character with basic animations (As a developer, I want a test character with basic animations for each perspective, so that I can validate the multi-perspective character system's functionality.)
- [ ] Test animation transitions within a perspective (As a developer, I want to validate animation transitions within each perspective, so that characters animate smoothly during gameplay actions.)
- [ ] Implement movement controller with direction support (As a player, I want my character to move correctly regardless of the visual perspective, so that gameplay feels consistent throughout the game.)
- [ ] Connect movement controller to point-and-click navigation (As a developer, I want the multi-perspective movement controller to integrate with the point-and-click navigation system, so that players experience consistent controls across all game areas.)
- [ ] Test character movement in a single perspective (As a developer, I want comprehensive testing of character movement within each perspective type, so that I can verify movement mechanics work correctly before moving to multi-perspective scenarios.)
- [ ] Create test districts with different perspective types (As a developer, I want test districts with different perspective types, so that I can verify the multi-perspective system works correctly across district transitions.)
- [ ] Implement perspective switching in character controller (As a developer, I want the character controller to handle perspective switching seamlessly, so that characters maintain appropriate behavior when moving between different districts.)
- [ ] Create test for transitions between different perspective districts (As a developer, I want comprehensive tests for character transitions between perspective types, so that I can verify the multi-perspective system functions correctly in real gameplay scenarios.)
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for both systems (As a developer, I want clear documentation for both the navigation and multi-perspective systems, so that I can understand, maintain, and extend these systems effectively.)
- [ ] Perform code review and optimization (As a developer, I want a thorough code review and optimization pass for both systems, so that the code remains maintainable and performs well in all scenarios.)
- [ ] Update existing documentation to reflect new systems (As a developer, I want all existing documentation updated to reflect the new navigation and multi-perspective systems, so that documentation remains accurate and comprehensive.)
- [ ] Create simple POC test sprites for perspective scaling validation (As a developer, I want simple geometric test sprites at multiple scales, so that I can validate the perspective scaling system without complex art assets.)
- [ ] Implement basic sprite perspective scaling system (As a developer, I want sprites to scale based on Y-position in perspective backgrounds, so that depth illusion is maintained in scenes with visual perspective.)
- [ ] Create sprite scaling test scene for validation (As a developer, I want a dedicated test scene for sprite scaling, so that I can validate perspective effects work correctly with different backgrounds and movement patterns.)
- [ ] Create audio system directory structure and core architecture (As a developer, I want to establish the foundational audio system architecture and file structure, so that all future audio development builds on a solid, well-organized base.)
- [ ] Implement basic AudioManager singleton (As a developer, I want a central AudioManager singleton that tracks the player's position and manages all diegetic audio sources, so that audio can respond dynamically to player movement.)
- [ ] Create simplified DiegeticAudioController component (As a developer, I want a reusable audio component that automatically adjusts volume based on distance from the player, so that we can easily add spatial audio to any game object.)
- [ ] Implement diegetic audio scaling system for perspective immersion (As a player, I want environmental sounds to naturally fade and pan based on my position and distance, so that the game world feels spatially realistic and immersive.)
- [ ] Integrate audio with perspective scaling system (As a player, I want audio volume to reflect not just distance but also the visual perspective scale, so that sounds feel naturally integrated with the visual depth of the scene.)
- [ ] Create audio foundation test scene and verify integration (As a developer, I want a comprehensive test scene for the audio MVP, so that I can verify all audio systems work correctly and establish a testing baseline for future development.)
- [ ] Create ForegroundOcclusionManager singleton for Y-position based sprite layering (As a player, I want to see my character naturally pass behind objects in the environment, so that the game world feels more three-dimensional and immersive.)
- [ ] Implement basic foreground element loading in base_district.gd (As a developer, I want districts to automatically load and manage foreground elements, so that adding visual depth to new areas is straightforward and consistent.)
- [ ] Extend district JSON configuration for foreground elements (As a developer, I want a simple configuration format for foreground elements, so that I can quickly add occlusion objects without writing code.)
- [ ] Create test foreground sprites for camera test backgrounds (As a developer, I want test foreground sprites for the camera test backgrounds, so that I can validate the occlusion system works correctly in various scenarios.)
- [ ] Build foreground occlusion test scene with debug visualization (As a developer, I want a dedicated test scene for the foreground occlusion system, so that I can verify correct behavior and debug issues efficiently.)
- [ ] Create male Alex character sprites following sprite workflow (As a player, I want to see a well-designed male version of Alex the courier with appropriate animations, so that my character feels authentic and matches the game's visual style.)
- [ ] Create female Alex character sprites following sprite workflow (As a player, I want to see a well-designed female version of Alex the courier with appropriate animations, so that I can choose a character that I identify with while maintaining the game's narrative integrity.)
- [ ] Generate character portraits for gender selection screen (As a player, I want clear character portraits on the gender selection screen, so that I can make an informed choice about my character before starting the game.)
- [ ] Validate both sprite sets work with multi-perspective system (As a developer, I want to ensure both gender sprite sets work correctly with all perspective types, so that players have a consistent experience regardless of their character choice.)

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Fix player getting stuck in DECELERATING/ACCELERATING loop when navigating around obstacles
- [ ] Analyze and potentially fix the failing tests to properly verify navigation behavior
- [x] Fix player.gd to use global_position instead of position for navigation calculations
- [ ] 

## Notes
- Current tests don't cover the specific navigation bug shown in screenshots. The issue: player gets stuck at intermediate waypoints when navigating around obstacles. The test_waypoint_sequential_following is failing (indices [0,1,2,3,0]) which indicates navigation state issues, but we need a test that specifically checks for: 1) Player making progress along navigation path, 2) Player not getting stuck at intermediate waypoints, 3) State machine transitions working correctly during multi-waypoint navigation.
- Tests are still failing but for different reasons than the original bug. The player_coordinate_mismatch_test is testing the mathematical difference between position and global_position (which will always exist when district is offset), not whether the player code uses the correct one. The test logic needs review - it's demonstrating that a coordinate space mismatch EXISTS (which is correct) but then expecting no mismatch (which is incorrect expectation).
- Reviewed system documentation (base_district, coordinate_system, walkable_area, scrolling_camera). Key insights: 1) Player is child of district so position != global_position when district is offset, 2) Navigation uses global coordinates, 3) is_position_walkable expects global coordinates, 4) Base district architecture is mandatory for proper camera/coordinate functionality. Fixed player.gd to use global_position for navigation calculations - this is architecturally correct.
