# Development Session: Iteration 3 Unit Testing Continued
**Date:** May 19, 2025
**Time:** 08:41:43
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Fixing Remaining Test Issues

## Session Goals
- Fix remaining unit test issues to ensure all tests can run successfully
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Fix coordinate manager test failures
- [ ] Fix remaining parse errors in camera_walkable_integration_test.gd
- [ ] Fix ScrollingCamera instantiation issues in camera_state_test.gd
- [ ] Fix BoundsCalculator test parameter mismatch for create_bounds_visualization()
- [ ] 

## Notes
- Fixed line break issue in coordinate_conversion_test.gd by creating a fully revised version that combines the problematic multi-line expressions into single lines. Also updated the test to use the same instantiation pattern for ScrollingCamera that we used in camera_state_test.gd, and added more robust error handling in end_test and end_test_suite functions similar to coordinate_manager_test.gd.
- Fixed coordinate manager test issues: (1) Added error handling for missing dictionary keys in end_test and end_test_suite functions, (2) Added fallback metadata properties for the mock district to ensure background_scale_factor and district_name are available for tests. These changes handle errors like 'Invalid get index' that were causing test failures.
- Fixed line break issue in camera_walkable_integration_test.gd by converting a multi-line boolean expression to a single line. This resolves the 'Error parsing expression, misplaced: 
' parse error.
- Fixed ScrollingCamera instantiation issue in camera_state_test.gd. The test was trying to instantiate a GDScript file directly with script.new(), which is not valid in Godot. Changed the code to properly create a Camera2D node and attach the script to it, which is the correct pattern for Godot script instantiation.
- Fixed BoundsCalculator.create_bounds_visualization() method call in bounds_calculator_test.gd by adding the required parent_node parameter. The method expects both a Rect2 bounds object and a parent Node2D to attach the visualization to.
- Previous session fixed several critical issues with unit tests including resource loading problems and parse errors caused by multi-line boolean expressions. The test runner was also enhanced with better timeouts and error handling. This session will focus on fixing the remaining issues to get the tests running successfully.
