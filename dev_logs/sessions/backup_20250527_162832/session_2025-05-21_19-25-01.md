# Development Session: Visual Bounds Bug Fix
**Date:** May 21, 2025
**Time:** 19:25:01
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Fix camera bounds calculation causing visual positioning issues using TDD approach

## Session Goals
- Fix visual positioning bug where camera bounds height (127px) vs viewport (952px) causes background to shift up with grey bar using TDD approach
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Ensure all existing 143 unit tests continue to pass after fix
- [ ] Enhance BoundsCalculator to consider viewport dimensions in height calculations
- [x] Fix failing visual_bounds_validation_test that reproduces bounds-to-viewport ratio issue
- [x] 

## Notes
- PARTIAL FIX: Bounds calculation working but being overridden by background scaling logic. Camera-system test shows viewport-aware bounds (285.6px height, 30% ratio) are calculated correctly but then replaced with full background bounds (952px height).
- TDD SUCCESS: Created failing visual_bounds_validation_test (13% ratio) → Enhanced BoundsCalculator with viewport awareness → Created failing ScrollingCamera test → Fixed ScrollingCamera._calculate_district_bounds() → All tests passing with 30% height ratio achieved.
- MAJOR PROGRESS: Successfully implemented viewport-aware bounds calculation using TDD approach. Enhanced BoundsCalculator with viewport dimensions support (30% minimum height ratio), created failing tests, and integrated into ScrollingCamera. All 145 unit tests now passing (up from 143).
- FAILING TEST: visual_bounds_validation_test shows bounds height 127px vs viewport 952px = 13% ratio instead of required 30% minimum, reproducing visual bug
- CONTEXT: Previous session resolved all 5 camera bugs, achieving 143/143 passing tests. Visual analysis revealed test coverage gap where bounds height calculation doesn't consider viewport dimensions, causing background positioning issues in camera-system test.
- 

## Next Steps
- Fix background positioning to eliminate grey bar issue completely
- Create test to verify bounds are not overridden by background scaling
- Investigate why background scaling logic overrides viewport-aware bounds in ScrollingCamera
