# Development Session: Design Document Analysis Verification
**Date:** May 27, 2025
**Time:** 14:54:34
**Iteration:** 2 - NPC Framework and Suspicion System
**Task Focus:** Verify implementation of design_document_analysis_report.md findings

## Session Goals
- 

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Analyze Iteration 3: Check design doc coverage, task-user story alignment, and MVP appropriateness
- [ ] Document findings and discrepancies
- [ ] Verify previously partially represented designs now have tasks
- [x] Verify previously unpresented designs now have task representation
- [x] Read and understand design_document_analysis_report.md
- [ ] 

## Notes
- FIXED ITERATION 3: Removed massive duplicate section (lines 824-1213) containing 19 duplicate user stories. Now has exactly 45 user story sections matching 45 tasks. All tasks have proper user stories with no duplicates.
- ITERATION 3 CORRECTION: Major issue found - 19 tasks have DUPLICATE user story sections. This explains the 64 user stories for 45 tasks. Need to remove duplicate user story sections for Tasks 3, 5, 6, 8-12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 20-24, 26, 27.
- FIXED ITERATION 4: Added all 14 missing user stories (Tasks 2, 4, 6-17). Now all 17 tasks have complete user stories with proper format including status history, requirements, acceptance criteria, and implementation notes.
- ITERATION 4 ANALYSIS: Serialization system well-designed for MVP with proper architecture. References modular_serialization_architecture.md and serialization_system.md. MAJOR ISSUE: Only 3/17 tasks have user stories (82% missing). Business/User requirements misaligned (reference wrong systems). Excellent preparation for future features.
- ITERATION 3 ANALYSIS: Design docs are properly represented. Navigation (1-12), Audio MVP (31-36), and Foreground Occlusion MVP (37-41) all align with their design documents. ISSUES: Missing user stories for Tasks 7, 25, 28. Task 2 has duplicate user story text. Some tasks missing status history.
- REVISED APPROACH: Will check each iteration's tasks against corresponding design documents, considering MVP (iterations 1-8) vs Full implementation (iterations 9+) phases. Some designs have separate MVP/Full docs, others combine both.
- VERIFIED: Assimilation system (assimilation_system_design.md) is correctly represented in Iteration 12, Tasks 1-5. Tasks include AssimilationManager singleton, infection spread mechanics, detection methods, visual indicators, and event system. Properly references design document.
- DISCREPANCY FOUND: main_menu_start_game_ui_design.md is claimed to lack tasks but actually HAS proper task representation in Iteration 6, Tasks 16-25. These tasks comprehensively cover title screen, save detection, warning dialogs, gender selection, prologue text, new game initialization, load functionality, CRT effects, error handling, and system integration.
- SUMMARY: All 6 previously unpresented designs claimed to be fully represented have been verified as accurate. Need to check the 4 that reportedly still lack tasks: main_menu_start_game_ui_design.md, puzzle_system_design.md, time_calendar_display_ui_design.md, and tram_transportation_system_design.md
- VERIFIED: Living world event system full (living_world_event_system_full.md) is correctly represented in Iteration 12, Tasks 26-35. Tasks include advanced event scheduler, 8-state NPC machine, rumor propagation, evidence discovery/decay, reaction chains, performance optimization for 100+ NPCs, quantum simulation, temporal reputation, differential serialization, and emergent narrative generation.
- VERIFIED: Time management full system (time_management_system_full.md) is correctly represented in Iteration 7, Tasks 26-35. Tasks include deadline management, conflict detection, fatigue system, stimulant usage, microsleep/hallucinations, temporal branching, schedule optimization, activity interruption, and time pressure visualization. Properly extends MVP from Iteration 5.
- VERIFIED: Trading floor minigame (trading_floor_minigame_system_design.md) is correctly represented in Iteration 11, Tasks 26-35. Tasks include TradingTerminal scene, BlockTrader Tetris gameplay, Game Boy effects, score-to-credits system, gender modifiers/harassment events, leaderboard, time consumption, job integration, save/load, and tutorial.
- VERIFIED: Hardware validation (hardware_validation_plan.md) is correctly represented in Iteration 24, Tasks 1-23. Tasks include hardware validation (1-6), custom Linux distribution (7-12), manufacturing pipeline (13-18), and user testing (19-23). This was moved to Phase 3 as requested.
- VERIFIED: Barracks system (barracks_system_design.md) is correctly represented in Iteration 7, Tasks 16-20. Tasks include barracks district scene, player quarters (Room 306), customization, storage system, and common areas.
- VERIFIED: Audio system (audio_system_iteration3_mvp.md & audio_system_technical_implementation.md) is correctly represented in Iteration 3, Tasks 31-36. Tasks include proper architecture, AudioManager, DiegeticAudioController, and spatial audio scaling - all aligning with design documents.
