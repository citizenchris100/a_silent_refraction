# Development Session: Coordinate Manager Test Fix
**Date:** May 20, 2025
**Time:** 15:40:47
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Resolving timeout issues in coordinate_manager_test

## Session Goals
- Fix coordinate_manager_test timeout issues
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Verify fixed test runs successfully without timeouts
- [ ] Fix identified issues in coordinate_manager_test
- [ ] Examine test logs to find where tests get stuck
- [ ] Analyze coordinate_manager_test code to identify timeout sources
- [ ] 

## Notes
- While we couldn't completely fix the timeouts, we've made progress by fixing the mock district implementation and adding better debugging and timeout protection. This should facilitate future work on these tests.
- The key issue we addressed was the proper implementation of the MockDistrict class to support property access via the 'in' operator and correctly handle method calls. We also added timeout protection to prevent tests from hanging indefinitely.
- After extensive debugging, we identified that the coordinate_manager_test is still timing out despite our fixes. This may be due to more complex issues with how the tests are structured or deeper bugs in the codebase. To fix this properly, a more comprehensive redesign of the test would be needed.
- Main issue identified: The coordinate_manager_test.gd is failing to create a proper mock district with the required script. There's a GDScript parse error ('Unexpected indentation') when trying to create the script on line 73-83. This causes cascading errors when trying to access 'background_scale_factor' and other properties, which then leads to the test getting stuck in an infinite yield loop when test_world_to_game_view fails.
