# Development Session: Fix view_mode_transition_test Timeout
**Date:** May 20, 2025
**Time:** 18:54:14
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Resolving timeout issues in view mode transition tests

## Session Goals
- Fix issues to ensure view_mode_transition_test completes successfully
- Identify the cause of timeout issues in view_mode_transition_test
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Verify fix by running the test
- [ ] Implement a forced timeout mechanism in the test
- [x] Check for infinite loops or incomplete yield statements
- [x] Examine view_mode_transition_test.gd for potential issues
- [ ] 

## Notes
- RESOURCE ISSUE: The test creates dynamic scripts at runtime through GDScript.new() and setting source_code, which might not be properly loading or could be causing issues with the test execution.
- INCOMPLETE YIELD: The test_coordinate_transformations_suite() and test_view_mode_detection_suite() call functions that interact with the CoordinateSystem and CoordinateManager classes which might not exist or be properly initialized in the test environment.
- POSSIBLE INFINITE LOOP: In the run_tests() function (lines 154-179), there are a series of yield statements calling test suites, but no timeout mechanism if any of these suites hangs.
- IDENTIFIED ISSUE: There's a potential issue with the CoordinateSystem and CoordinateManager mocks/references which might be causing errors or infinite loops when their functions are called.
- IDENTIFIED ISSUE: The test has a complex setup with multiple dynamically created mock objects using runtime-created scripts, which could be causing initialization or reference issues.
- IDENTIFIED ISSUE: The test has a large number of yield statements without proper fallbacks or timeouts on each one, which could lead to infinite waiting for signals that never complete.
- IDENTIFIED ISSUE: The view_mode_transition_test lacks a master timeout mechanism that would force the test to complete after a certain period, regardless of other yield statements.
