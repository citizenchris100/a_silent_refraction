# Development Session: Fix coordinate_system_test Timeout
**Date:** May 21, 2025
**Time:** 13:42:59
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Resolving timeout issues in coordinate_system_test unit test

## Session Goals
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Notes
- Successfully fixed coordinate_system_test timeout issues! All 21 tests now pass with proper GREEN output. Optimized test performance from 60+ seconds to ~2 seconds through better mock object handling and removal of unnecessary yield statements. Test integrity was maintained while dramatically improving performance.
- 

## Next Steps
- Apply similar reliability and performance fixes to camera_walkable_integration_test - the final failing test with timeout issues
- Apply similar reliability and performance fixes to coordinate_transformation_test - the next test in the priority list
