# Development Session: Coordinate Manager Test Refactoring
**Date:** May 20, 2025
**Time:** 16:35:46
**Iteration:** 3 - Game Districts and Time Management
**Task Focus:** Implementing a new version of the coordinate_manager_test to fix timeout issues

## Session Goals
- 

## Related Iteration Tasks
- [ ] Create at least one additional district besides Shipping
- [ ] Create bash script for generating NPC placeholders (As a developer, I want a bash script that manages the NPC registry and creates appropriate directory structures for NPC sprites, so that I can easily add new characters to the game with proper integration into the existing systems without manual configuration.)
- [ ] Implement district transitions via tram system
- [ ] Develop in-game clock and calendar system
- [ ] Create time progression through player actions
- [ ] Implement day cycle with sleep mechanics
- [ ] Design and implement time UI indicators
- [ ] Create system for random NPC assimilation over time
- [ ] Add time-based events and triggers
- [ ] Implement player bedroom as save point location
- [ ] Create single-slot save system with confirmation UI
- [ ] Create basic inventory system with size limitations

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Test the implementation and validate it works without timeout issues
- [ ] Create minimal test suite focusing on district and camera integration
- [ ] Implement improved timeout mechanism with proper cleanup
- [ ] Add basic test setup with simplified camera and district initialization
- [ ] Create coordinate_manager_test_new.gd with simplified MockDistrict implementation
- [ ] 

## Notes
- Implemented a completely new coordinate_manager_test that successfully passes and replaced the original. Added proposals for more robust test cases to the design document for future enhancement.
- Created a new coordinate_manager_test_new.gd with a simplified approach. The implementation includes a streamlined MockDistrict class, improved test timeout handling, and a step-by-step test execution process.
