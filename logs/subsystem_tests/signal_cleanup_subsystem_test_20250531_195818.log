========== DISTRICT BOUNDS CALCULATION STARTED ==========
Background dimensions: (1920, 1080)
Screen size: (1424, 952)
Current camera zoom: (1, 1)
Number of walkable areas: 1

========== BOUNDS CALCULATION STARTED ==========
Number of walkable areas: 1
Using get_polygon() interface method
Processing walkable area: WalkableArea with 4 points
Area transform: ((1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0))
Point 0 - Local: (100, 100), Global: (100, 100)
Point 1 - Local: (1820, 100), Global: (1820, 100)
Point 2 - Local: (1820, 980), Global: (1820, 980)
Point 3 - Local: (100, 980), Global: (100, 980)
Note: Rect2.expand() did not change bounds for point (100, 980) - this is normal for some polygon arrangements
Raw calculated bounds: (100, 100, 1720, 880)
Bounds after margin adjustment: (99, 99, 1722, 882)
Final corrected bounds: (99, 99, 1722, 882)
========== BOUNDS CALCULATION COMPLETED ==========

Viewport-aware height calculation: 952 * 0.3 = 285.6
Final district bounds: (99, 99, 1722, 882)
========== DISTRICT BOUNDS CALCULATION COMPLETED ==========

Camera bounds set from district: (99, 99, 1722, 882)

===== CALCULATING OPTIMAL ZOOM =====
Found background sprite with texture size: (1920, 1080)
Current background scale: (1, 1)
Effective background size with current scale: (1920, 1080)
Scale needed to fill viewport height: 0.881481
Applied new scale to background: (0.881481, 0.881481)
[SCALING DEBUG] Background vertical positioning applied:
[SCALING DEBUG] - Viewport height: 952
[SCALING DEBUG] - Scaled background height: 952
[SCALING DEBUG] - Applied y_offset: 0
New effective background size: (1692.444458, 952)
Camera zoom left at 1.0 (since we're scaling the background)
Updated district.background_size to (1692.444458, 952)
Updated camera bounds to match scaled background for visual correctness: (0, 0, 1692.444458, 952)
Updated bounds validator with new camera bounds
