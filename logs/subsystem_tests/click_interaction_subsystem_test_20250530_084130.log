========== DISTRICT BOUNDS CALCULATION STARTED ==========
Background dimensions: (2400, 1800)
Screen size: (1424, 952)
Current camera zoom: (1, 1)
Number of walkable areas: 0

========== BOUNDS CALCULATION STARTED ==========
Number of walkable areas: 0
WARNING: No valid walkable areas found, using default bounds
Raw calculated bounds: (0, 0, 800, 600)
Bounds after margin adjustment: (-1, -1, 802, 602)
Final corrected bounds: (-1, -1, 802, 602)
========== BOUNDS CALCULATION COMPLETED ==========

Viewport-aware height calculation: 952 * 0.3 = 285.6
NOTE: Walkable area is much smaller than background.
This is often intentional for floor-based walkable areas.
Using the exact walkable area as specified in the coordinates.
Final district bounds: (-1, -1, 802, 602)
========== DISTRICT BOUNDS CALCULATION COMPLETED ==========

Camera bounds set from district: (-1, -1, 802, 602)

===== CAMERA INITIAL POSITION SETUP =====
Current camera position: (0, 0)
Initial position setting: (0, 0)
Initial view setting: right
Screen size: (1424, 952)

===== CALCULATING OPTIMAL ZOOM =====
Found background sprite with texture size: (2400, 1800)
Current background scale: (1, 1)
Effective background size with current scale: (2400, 1800)
Scale needed to fill viewport height: 0.528889
Applied new scale to background: (0.528889, 0.528889)
[SCALING DEBUG] Background vertical positioning applied:
[SCALING DEBUG] - Viewport height: 952
[SCALING DEBUG] - Scaled background height: 952
[SCALING DEBUG] - Applied y_offset: 0
New effective background size: (1269.333374, 952)
Camera zoom left at 1.0 (since we're scaling the background)
Updated district.background_size to (1269.333374, 952)
Updated camera bounds to match scaled background for visual correctness: (0, 0, 1269.333374, 952)
Updated bounds validator with new camera bounds
===== ZOOM CALCULATION COMPLETE =====

Camera half size (screen size / 2 / zoom): (712, 476)
Camera bounds: (0, 0, 1269.333374, 952)
Background wide enough for scrolling: False
Background width: 1269.333374, Min width for scrolling: 2136

[CAMERA DEBUG] Checking camera position against walkable area center
Camera positioned for initial view: right at (635, 476)
View ratio: 112% of background is visible (1424 pixels of 1269.333374 pixels)
