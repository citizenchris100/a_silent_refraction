Screen size: (1424, 952)
Current camera zoom: (1, 1)
Number of walkable areas: 1

========== BOUNDS CALCULATION STARTED ==========
Number of walkable areas: 1
Using get_polygon() interface method
Processing walkable area: MainWalkableArea with 4 points
Area transform: ((1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0))
Point 0 - Local: (100, 200), Global: (100, 200)
Point 1 - Local: (1820, 200), Global: (1820, 200)
Point 2 - Local: (1820, 880), Global: (1820, 880)
Point 3 - Local: (100, 880), Global: (100, 880)
Note: Rect2.expand() did not change bounds for point (100, 880) - this is normal for some polygon arrangements
Raw calculated bounds: (100, 200, 1720, 680)
Bounds after margin adjustment: (99, 199, 1722, 682)
Final corrected bounds: (99, 199, 1722, 682)
========== BOUNDS CALCULATION COMPLETED ==========

Viewport-aware height calculation: 952 * 0.3 = 285.6
Final district bounds: (99, 199, 1722, 682)
