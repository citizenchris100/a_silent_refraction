Running test: Convert for Game View
Converting coordinates: pos=(100, 100), view_mode=GAME_VIEW
No conversion needed in Game View mode
âœ“ PASS: Convert for Game View: In game view, coordinates should remain unchanged
Running test: Convert for World View
DEBUG: Detected World View mode via full_view_mode property
Converting coordinates: pos=(200, 200), view_mode=WORLD_VIEW
Converted World View â†’ Game View: (200, 200) â†’ (100, 100)
âœ“ PASS: Convert for World View: In world view, coordinates should be converted to game view
Running test: Convenience Methods Edge Cases
Converting coordinates: pos=(0, 0), view_mode=GAME_VIEW
No conversion needed in Game View mode
Converting coordinates: pos=(999999, 999999), view_mode=GAME_VIEW
No conversion needed in Game View mode
Converting coordinates: pos=(-100, -100), view_mode=GAME_VIEW
No conversion needed in Game View mode
WARNING: convert_coordinates_for_current_view received null district
âœ“ PASS: Convenience Methods Edge Cases: Convenience methods should handle edge case parameters gracefully
