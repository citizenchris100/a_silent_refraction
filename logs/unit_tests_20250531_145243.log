========== BOUNDS CALCULATION STARTED ==========
Number of walkable areas: 1
Using get_polygon() interface method
Processing walkable area: @TestPolygon@6 with 4 points
Area transform: ((1, 0), (0, 1), (0, 0))
Point 0 - Local: (0, 822), Global: (0, 822)
Point 1 - Local: (4691, 822), Global: (4691, 822)
Point 2 - Local: (4691, 947), Global: (4691, 947)
Point 3 - Local: (0, 947), Global: (0, 947)
Note: Rect2.expand() did not change bounds for point (0, 947) - this is normal for some polygon arrangements
Raw calculated bounds: (0, 822, 4691, 125)
Bounds after margin adjustment: (-1, 821, 4693, 127)
Final corrected bounds: (-1, 821, 4693, 127)
========== BOUNDS CALCULATION COMPLETED ==========

Viewport-aware height calculation: 952 * 0.3 = 285.6
INFO: Walkable area height is 127 pixels
This is normal for floor-based walkable areas
Adjusting camera height bounds to 285.6 pixels for better visibility
Height-to-viewport ratio: 0.3 (30%)
This preserves the exact floor walkable area while improving camera view
Final district bounds: (-1, 741.700012, 4693, 285.600006)
========== DISTRICT BOUNDS CALCULATION COMPLETED ==========

Expected viewport-aware bounds: (-1, 741.700012, 4693, 285.600006)
Expected bounds height: 285.600006
Expected height ratio: 0.3

===== CALCULATING OPTIMAL ZOOM =====
Found background sprite with texture size: (2448, 496)
Current background scale: (1, 1)
Effective background size with current scale: (2448, 496)
Scale needed to fill viewport height: 1.919355
Applied new scale to background: (1.919355, 1.919355)
[SCALING DEBUG] Background vertical positioning applied:
[SCALING DEBUG] - Viewport height: 952
[SCALING DEBUG] - Scaled background height: 952
[SCALING DEBUG] - Applied y_offset: 0
New effective background size: (4698.580566, 952)
Camera zoom left at 1.0 (since we're scaling the background)
Updated district.background_size to (4698.580566, 952)
Updated camera bounds to match scaled background for visual correctness: (0, 0, 4698.580566, 952)
===== ZOOM CALCULATION COMPLETE =====

Bounds after background scaling: (0, 0, 4698.580566, 952)
Bounds height after scaling: 952
Height ratio after scaling: 1
Were bounds overridden: True
Do bounds match background size: True
SUCCESS: Background scaling correctly overrode bounds for visual correctness!
  - Original bounds height: 285.600006
  - New bounds height: 952
  - This prevents grey bar visual issue!
âœ“ PASS: Background Scaling Bounds Override For Visual Correctness: Background scaling should override viewport-aware bounds to prevent grey bar visual artifacts

SUCCESS: calculate_optimal_zoom() correctly overrode bounds!
  - Original bounds height: 285.600006
  - New bounds height: 952
  - This enables proper background scaling without grey bars
âœ“ PASS: Calculate Optimal Zoom Overrides Bounds For Visual Correctness: calculate_optimal_zoom() should override bounds when background scaling requires it for visual correctness
